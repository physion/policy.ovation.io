# Data Retention Policy

Despite not being a requirement within HIPAA, Ovation understand and appreciates the importance of health data retention. Acting as a business associate, and at times a subcontractor, Ovation is not directly responsible for health and medical records retention as set forth by each state. Despite this, Ovation has created and implemented the following policy to make it easier for Ovation Customers to support data retention laws.

## State Medical Record Laws

## Data Retention Policy

* Current Ovation Customers have data stored by Ovation as a part of the Ovation Service.
* Once a Customer ceases to be a Customer, as defined below, the following steps are
	1. Customer is sent a notice via email of change of standing, and given the option to reinstate account.
	2. If no response to notice in #1 above within 7 days, or if Customer responds they do not want to reinstate account, Customer is sent directions for how to download their data from Ovation and/or to have Ovation continue to store the data at a rate of $25/month for up to 100GB. If there is more than 100GB of data, Ovation will work with Customer to determine storage costs.
	3. If Customer downloads data or does not respond to notices from Ovation within 30 days, Ovation removed data from Ovation systems and Customer is sent notice of removal of data.
