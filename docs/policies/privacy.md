  c.   We may de-identify information such that the resulting de-identified data, including de-identified protected health information (PHI), is not individually identifiable information as provided in 45 CFR § 164.514, and we may provide such data in de-identified or aggregated form (combined with other data, results or measurements) to our partners. However, we never disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner that would identify you or any other individual.
