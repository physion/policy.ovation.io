## 4.	PERMITTED AND REQUIRED USES AND DISCLOSURES.

  a.	**Service Offerings.** Business Associate may use or disclose PHI in connection with the performance of the Services if such use or disclosure of PHI would not violate HIPAA if done by Customer or if such use or disclosure is expressly permitted under this BAA or the Services Agreement.  

  b.	**Administration and Management of Services.** Business Associate may use or disclose PHI received by Business Associate in its capacity as "business associate" of Customer for the proper management and administration of Business Associate.  Any such disclosure of PHI shall only be made if Business Associate obtains reasonable assurances from the person to whom the PHI is disclosed that: (1) the PHI will be held confidentially and used or further disclosed only as required by law or for the purpose for which it was disclosed to the person; (2) Business Associate will be notified by such person of any instances of which it becomes aware in which the confidentiality of the PHI has been breached; and (3) the person will provide Business Associate appropriate notice and opportunity to object before disclosing PHI on the basis that such disclosure is required by law.

  c.	**Disclosures Required By Law.**  Business Associate may only use or disclose PHI on the basis that such disclosure is required by law after notifying Customer’s Privacy Officer or his/her designee to allow an opportunity to object to the disclosure and to seek appropriate relief.  If Customer objects to such disclosure, Business Associate shall, to the extent legally permitted, refrain from disclosing the PHI until Customer has exhausted all alternatives for relief.  However, if Business Associate is unable to notify Customer for reasons beyond Business Associate’s control, Business Associate may disclose PHI on the basis that such disclosure is required by law so long as Business Associate provides immediate notice to Customer’s Privacy Officer or his/her designee following the disclosure.

  d.	**Disclosure to Subcontractors.**  Business Associate shall ensure that any subcontractors that create, receive, maintain or transmit PHI on behalf of Business Associate agree, in a writing that complies with the requirements of 45 C.F.R. §164.504(e)(2) through (e)(4), to be bound by the same restrictions and conditions that apply to Business Associate under this BAA with respect to such PHI, including, without limitation, implementing reasonable and appropriate safeguards to protect it.  

  e.	Data Aggregation.  To the extent permitted by the Services Agreement, or as otherwise expressly agreed to in writing by Customer, Business Associate may use and disclose PHI for data aggregation purposes, however, only in order to analyze data for permitted health care operations of Customer, and only to the extent that such use is permitted under HIPAA.

## 5.	OBLIGATIONS OF BUSINESS ASSOCIATE.
  a.	**Limit on Uses and Disclosures.** Business Associate will use and disclose PHI only as permitted by this BAA or as Required By Law.  If Customer notifies Business Associate that Customer has agreed to be bound by additional restrictions on the uses or disclosures of PHI pursuant to HIPAA, Business Associate and Customer shall mutually agree on the extent to which Business Associate will be bound by such additional restrictions and Business Associate shall not disclose PHI in violation of such additional mutually agreed upon restrictions.

  b.	**Safeguards.** Business Associate will use reasonable and appropriate safeguards to prevent Use or Disclosure of PHI other than as provided for by this BAA, consistent with the requirements of Subpart C of 45 C.F.R.

Notice is hereby deemed provided, and no further notice will be provided, for unsuccessful attempts at such unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction, such as pings and other broadcast attacks on a firewall, denial of service attacks, port scans, unsuccessful login attempts, or interception of encrypted information where the key is not compromised, or any combination of the above.

  e.	**Reporting of Breaches.** Business Associate will report to Customer any Breach of Customer’s Unsecured PHI that Business Associate may discover to the extent required by 45 C.F.R. §164.410.

  g.	**Internal Records.** Business Associate will make its internal practices, books, and records relating to the Use and Disclosure of PHI available to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for purposes of determining Customer compliance with HIPAA. Nothing in this section will waive any applicable privilege or protection, including with respect to trade secrets and confidential commercial information.

## 6.	CUSTOMER’S OBLIGATIONS.
  a.	**Appropriate Use of HIPAA Accounts.** At all times, Customer will comply with the Privacy Rules, Security Rules and other applicable laws and regulations.

Customer will promptly notify Business Associate of any changes in, or withdrawal of, such written permission provided to Customer by Individuals or their personal representatives, including without limitation revocations of authorizations pursuant to 45 CFR §164.508.  Customer will also promptly notify Business Associate of any restrictions to the use and disclosure of PHI that Customer has agreed to in accordance with 45 CFR §164.522, to the extent that such restrictions affect Business Associate’s use or disclosure of PHI.

  c.	**Restrictions on Disclosures.** Customer shall not agree to any request for restrictions or place any restrictions in any notice of its privacy practices that would cause Business Associate to violate this BAA, the Services Agreement or any applicable law.

## 7.	TERM AND TERMINATION.

  a.	**Term.** The term of this BAA will commence on the BAA Effective Date and will remain in effect until the termination of the Contract.

  b.	**Effect of Termination.** At termination of this BAA, Business Associate, if feasible, will return or destroy all PHI that Business Associate still maintains, if any. If return or destruction is not feasible, Business Associate will extend the protections of this BAA to the PHI, limit further uses and disclosures to those purposes that make the return of the PHI infeasible, and make no further use or disclosure of PHI.

  c.	**Account Access.** If Customer requests contemporaneously with any termination event or notice, Business Associate will allow Customer to have access to Customer’s Account for a reasonable period of time following termination as necessary for Customer to retrieve or delete any PHI at its then current monthly recurring rate; provided, however, that if the security of Customer’s servers has been compromised, or the Services Agreement was terminated by Customer’s failure to use reasonable security precautions, Business Associate may: (i) provide Customer with restricted access via a dedicated or private link or tunnel to Customer Account or (ii) refuse to allow Customer to have access to Customer’s Account but will use reasonable efforts to copy Service Data onto media Customer provides to Business Associate, and will ship the media to Customer at Customer's risk and expense. Business Associate’s efforts to copy Service Data onto Customer-supplied media shall be billable as an Additional Service at Business Associate’s then current hourly rates.

  d.	**De-identification.** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Business Associate may de-identify some or all of the PHI, in which case Business Associate may retain, use and disclose such de-identified PHI for the purposes described in the Services Agreement (including without limitation, for Analytics).  For clarity, any PHI that is de-identified shall cease to be PHI for the purposes of this BAA and Business Associate will have no further obligation with respect to such information and data under this BAA.


## 8.	MISCELLANEOUS.
  a.	**Amendment.** Customer and Business Associate agrees to take such action as is reasonably necessary to amend this BAA from time to time as is necessary for either party to comply with the requirements of the Privacy Rule and related laws and regulations.

  d.	**Entire Agreement.** This BAA constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior negotiations, understandings or agreements (oral or written), between the parties regarding the subject matter hereof.  All notices under this BAA will be in writing and delivered to the parties at their respective addresses as provided in the Services Agreement.  Neither party shall be liable for any delay or failure in performing its obligations hereunder that arises out of any cause, condition or circumstance beyond its reasonable control.  Nothing in this BAA confers upon any person other than the parties (and their respective successors and permitted assigns) any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities whatsoever.
