Threats are commonly categorized as:\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental \u2013 external fires, HVAC failure/temperature inadequacy, water pipe burst, power failure/fluctuation, etc.\n\n\nHuman \u2013 hackers, data entry, workforce/ex-workforce members, impersonation, insertion of malicious code, theft, viruses, SPAM, vandalism, etc.\n\n\nNatural \u2013 fires, floods, electrical storms, tornados, etc.\n\n\nTechnological \u2013 server failure, software failure, ancillary equipment failure, etc. and environmental threats, such as power outages, hazardous material spills.\n\n\nOther \u2013 explosions, medical emergencies, misuse or resources, etc. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThreat Source\n: Any circumstance or event with the potential to cause harm (intentional or unintentional) to an IT system. Common threat sources can be natural, human or environmental which can impact the organization\u2019s ability to protect ePHI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThreat Action\n: The method by which an attack might be carried out (e.g., hacking, system intrusion, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnrestricted Area\n: Those areas of the building(s) where protected health information and/or sensitive organizational information is not stored or is not utilized or is not accessible there on a regular basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnsecured Protected Health Information\n: Protected health information (PHI) that is not rendered unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable to unauthorized individuals through the use of technology or methodology specified by the Secretary in the guidance issued under section 13402(h)(2) of Pub. L.111-5 on the HHS website.\n\n\n\n\nElectronic PHI has been encrypted as specified in the HIPAA Security rule by the use of an algorithmic process to transform data into a form in which there is a low probability of assigning meaning without the use of a confidential process or key and such confidential process or key that might enable decryption has not been breached. To avoid a breach of the confidential process or key, these decryption tools should be stored on a device or at a location separate from the data they are used to encrypt or decrypt. The following encryption processes meet this standard.\n\n\nValid encryption processes for data at rest (i.e. data that resides in databases, file systems and other structured storage systems) are consistent with NIST Special Publication 800-111, Guide to Storage Encryption Technologies for End User Devices.\n\n\nValid encryption processes for data in motion (i.e. data that is moving through a network, including wireless transmission) are those that comply, as appropriate, with NIST Special Publications 800-52, Guidelines for the Selection and Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) Implementations; 800-77, Guide to IPSec VPNs; or 800-113, Guide to SSL VPNs, and may include others which are Federal Information Processing Standards FIPS 140-2 validated.\n\n\nThe media on which the PHI is stored or recorded has been destroyed in the following ways:\n\n\nPaper, film, or other hard copy media have been shredded or destroyed such that the PHI cannot be read or otherwise cannot be reconstructed. Redaction is specifically excluded as a means of data destruction.\n\n\nElectronic media have been cleared, purged, or destroyed consistent with NIST Special Publications 800-88, Guidelines for Media Sanitization, such that the PHI cannot be retrieved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVendors\n: Persons from other organizations marketing or selling products or services, or providing services to Ovation. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVulnerability\n: A weakness or flaw in an information system that can be accidentally triggered or intentionally exploited by a threat and lead to a compromise in the integrity of that system, i.e., resulting in a security breach or violation of policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkstation\n: An electronic computing device, such as a laptop or desktop computer, or any other device that performs similar functions, used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI. Workstation devices may include, but are not limited to: laptop or desktop computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), tablet PCs, and other handheld devices. For the purposes of this policy, \u201cworkstation\u201d also includes the combination of hardware, operating system, application software, and network connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkforce\n: Means employees, volunteers, trainees, and other persons whose conduct, in the performance of work for a covered entity, is under the direct control of such entity, whether or not they are paid by the covered entity.",

An audit may be done as a periodic event, as a result of a patient complaint, or suspicion of employee wrongdoing.    Audit Controls : Technical mechanisms that track and record computer/system activities.    Audit Logs : Encrypted records of activity maintained by the system which provide: 1) date and time of activity; 2) origin of activity (app); 3) identification of user doing activity; and 4) data accessed as part of activity.    Access : Means the ability or the means necessary to read, write, modify, or communicate data or information or otherwise use any system resource.    Backup : The process of making an electronic copy of data stored in a computer system. This can either be complete, meaning all data and programs, or incremental, including just the data that changed from the previous backup.    Breach : Means the acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of protected health information (PHI) in a manner not permitted under the Privacy Rule which compromises the security or privacy of the PHI. For purpose of this definition, \u201ccompromises the security or privacy of the PHI\u201d means poses a significant risk of financial, reputational, or other harm to the individual. A use or disclosure of PHI that does not include the identifiers listed at \u00a7164.514(e)(2), limited data set, date of birth, and zip code does not compromise the security or privacy of the PHI. Breach excludes:   Any unintentional acquisition, access or use of PHI by a workforce member or person acting under the authority of a Covered Entity (CE) or Business Associate (BA) if such acquisition, access, or use was made in good faith and within the scope of authority and does not result in further use or disclosure in a manner not permitted under the Privacy Rule.  Any inadvertent disclosure by a person who is authorized to access PHI at a CE or BA to another person authorized to access PHI at the same CE or BA, or organized health care arrangement in which the CE participates, and the information received as a result of such disclosure is not further used or disclosed in a manner not permitted under the Privacy Rule.  A disclosure of PHI where a CE or BA has a good faith belief that an unauthorized person to whom the disclosure was made would not reasonably have been able to retain such information.

Indication : A sign that an Incident may have occurred or may be occurring at the present time. Examples of indications include:   The network intrusion detection sensor alerts when a known exploit occurs against an FTP server. Intrusion detection is generally reactive, looking only for footprints of known attacks. It is important to note that many IDS \u201chits\u201d are also false positives and are neither an event nor an incident;  The antivirus software alerts when it detects that a host is infected with a worm;  Users complain of slow access to hosts on the Internet;  The system administrator sees a filename with unusual characteristics;  Automated alerts of activity from log monitors like OSSEC;  An alert from OSSEC about file system integrity issues.

Risk : The likelihood that a threat will exploit a vulnerability, and the impact of that event on the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of ePHI, other confidential or proprietary electronic information, and other system assets.    Risk Management Team : Individuals who are knowledgeable about the Organization\u2019s HIPAA Privacy, Security and HITECH policies, procedures, training program, computer system set up, and technical security controls, and who are responsible for the risk management process and procedures outlined below.    Risk Assessment : (Referred to as Risk Analysis in the HIPAA Security Rule); the process:   Identifies the risks to information system security and determines the probability of occurrence and the resulting impact for each threat/vulnerability pair identified given the security controls in place;  Prioritizes risks; and  Results in recommended possible actions/controls that could reduce or offset the determined risk.     Risk Management : Within this policy, it refers to two major process components: risk assessment and risk mitigation. This differs from the HIPAA Security Rule, which defines it as a risk mitigation process only. The definition used in this policy is consistent with the one used in documents published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).    Risk Mitigation : Referred to as Risk Management in the HIPAA Security Rule, and is a process that prioritizes, evaluates, and implements security controls that will reduce or offset the risks determined in the risk assessment process to satisfactory levels within an organization given its mission and available resources.    Security Incident  (or just Incident): A security incident is an occurrence that exercises a significant adverse effect on people, process, technology, or data. Security incidents include, but are not limited to:    A system or network breach accomplished by an internal or external entity; this breach can be inadvertent or malicious;  Unauthorized disclosure;  Unauthorized change or destruction of ePHI (i.e. delete dictation, data alterations not following Ovation\u2019s procedures);  Denial of service not attributable to identifiable physical, environmental, human or technology causes;  Disaster or enacted threat to business continuity;  Information Security Incident: A violation or imminent threat of violation of information security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices. Examples of information security incidents may include, but are not limited to, the following:  Denial of Service: An attack that prevents or impairs the authorized use of networks, systems, or applications by exhausting resources;  Malicious Code: A virus, worm, Trojan horse, or other code-based malicious entity that infects a host;  Unauthorized Access/System Hijacking: A person gains logical or physical access without permission to a network, system, application, data, or other resource. Hijacking occurs when an attacker takes control of network devices or workstations;  Inappropriate Usage: A person violates acceptable computing use policies;  Other examples of observable information security incidents may include, but are not limited to:  Use of another person\u2019s individual password and/or account to login to a system;  Failure to protect passwords and/or access codes (e.g., posting passwords on equipment);  Installation of unauthorized software;  Terminated workforce member accessing applications, systems, or network.       Threat : The potential for a particular threat-source to successfully exercise a particular vulnerability. Threats are commonly categorized as:   Environmental \u2013 external fires, HVAC failure/temperature inadequacy, water pipe burst, power failure/fluctuation, etc.  Human \u2013 hackers, data entry, workforce/ex-workforce members, impersonation, insertion of malicious code, theft, viruses, SPAM, vandalism, etc.  Natural \u2013 fires, floods, electrical storms, tornados, etc.  Technological \u2013 server failure, software failure, ancillary equipment failure, etc. and environmental threats, such as power outages, hazardous material spills.  Other \u2013 explosions, medical emergencies, misuse or resources, etc.      Threat Source : Any circumstance or event with the potential to cause harm (intentional or unintentional) to an IT system. Common threat sources can be natural, human or environmental which can impact the organization\u2019s ability to protect ePHI.    Threat Action : The method by which an attack might be carried out (e.g., hacking, system intrusion, etc.).    Unrestricted Area : Those areas of the building(s) where protected health information and/or sensitive organizational information is not stored or is not utilized or is not accessible there on a regular basis.    Unsecured Protected Health Information : Protected health information (PHI) that is not rendered unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable to unauthorized individuals through the use of technology or methodology specified by the Secretary in the guidance issued under section 13402(h)(2) of Pub. L.111-5 on the HHS website.   Electronic PHI has been encrypted as specified in the HIPAA Security rule by the use of an algorithmic process to transform data into a form in which there is a low probability of assigning meaning without the use of a confidential process or key and such confidential process or key that might enable decryption has not been breached. To avoid a breach of the confidential process or key, these decryption tools should be stored on a device or at a location separate from the data they are used to encrypt or decrypt. The following encryption processes meet this standard.  Valid encryption processes for data at rest (i.e. data that resides in databases, file systems and other structured storage systems) are consistent with NIST Special Publication 800-111, Guide to Storage Encryption Technologies for End User Devices.  Valid encryption processes for data in motion (i.e. data that is moving through a network, including wireless transmission) are those that comply, as appropriate, with NIST Special Publications 800-52, Guidelines for the Selection and Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) Implementations; 800-77, Guide to IPSec VPNs; or 800-113, Guide to SSL VPNs, and may include others which are Federal Information Processing Standards FIPS 140-2 validated.  The media on which the PHI is stored or recorded has been destroyed in the following ways:  Paper, film, or other hard copy media have been shredded or destroyed such that the PHI cannot be read or otherwise cannot be reconstructed. Redaction is specifically excluded as a means of data destruction.  Electronic media have been cleared, purged, or destroyed consistent with NIST Special Publications 800-88, Guidelines for Media Sanitization, such that the PHI cannot be retrieved.     Vendors : Persons from other organizations marketing or selling products or services, or providing services to Ovation.     Vulnerability : A weakness or flaw in an information system that can be accidentally triggered or intentionally exploited by a threat and lead to a compromise in the integrity of that system, i.e., resulting in a security breach or violation of policy.    Workstation : An electronic computing device, such as a laptop or desktop computer, or any other device that performs similar functions, used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI. Workstation devices may include, but are not limited to: laptop or desktop computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), tablet PCs, and other handheld devices. For the purposes of this policy, \u201cworkstation\u201d also includes the combination of hardware, operating system, application software, and network connection.    Workforce : Means employees, volunteers, trainees, and other persons whose conduct, in the performance of work for a covered entity, is under the direct control of such entity, whether or not they are paid by the covered entity.",

All connections to Ovation are monitored. Access is limited to certain services, ports, and destinations. Exceptions to these rules, if created, are reviewed on an annual basis.     Ovation\u2019s auditing processes shall address access and activity at the following levels listed below. Auditing processes may address date and time of each log-on attempt, date and time of each log-off attempt, devices used, functions performed, etc.  User: User level audit trails generally monitor and log all commands directly initiated by the user, all identification and authentication attempts, and data and services accessed.  Application: Application level audit trails generally monitor and log all user activities, including data accessed and modified and specific actions.  System: System level audit trails generally monitor and log user activities, applications accessed, and other system defined specific actions. Ovation utilizes file system monitoring from OSSEC to assure the integrity of file system data.  Network: Network level audit trails generally monitor information on what is operating, penetrations, and vulnerabilities.    Ovation shall log all incoming and outgoing traffic to into and out of its environment. This includes all successful and failed attempts at data access and editing. Data associated with this data will include origin, destination, time, and other relevant details that are available to Ovation.  Ovation utilizes OSSEC to scan all systems for malicious and unauthorized software every 2 hours and at reboot of systems.

Breach notification will be carried out in compliance with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA)/Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) as well as any other federal or state notification law.\n\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has published breach notification rules for vendors of personal health records as required by ARRA/HITECH. The FTC rule applies to entities not covered by HIPAA, primarily vendors of personal health records. The rule is effective September 24, 2009 with full compliance required by February 22, 2010.\n\n\nThe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. Title XIII of ARRA is the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH). HITECH significantly impacts the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules.  While HIPAA did not require notification when patient protected health information (PHI) was inappropriately disclosed, covered entities and business associates may have chosen to include notification as part of the mitigation process. HITECH does require notification of certain breaches of unsecured PHI to the following: individuals, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the media. The effective implementation for this provision is September 23, 2009 (pending publication HHS regulations).\n\n\nIn the case of a breach, Ovation shall notify all affected Customers. It is the responsibility of the Customers to notify affected individuals.\n\n\nApplicable Standards from the HITRUST Common Security Framework\n\n\n\n\n11.a Reporting Information Security Events\n\n\n11.c Responsibilities and Procedures\n\n\n\n\nApplicable Standards from the HIPAA Security Rule\n\n\n\n\nSecurity Incident Procedures - 164.308(a)(6)(i)\n\n\nHITECH Notification in the Case of Breach - 13402(a) and 13402(b)\n\n\nHITECH Timeliness of Notification - 13402(d)(1)\n\n\nHITECH Content of Notification - 13402(f)(1)\n\n\n\n\nOvation Breach Policy\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery of Breach: A breach of ePHI shall be treated as \u201cdiscovered\u201d as of the first day on which such breach is known to the organization, or, by exercising reasonable diligence would have been known to Ovation (includes breaches by the organization\u2019s Customers, Partners, or subcontractors). Ovation shall be deemed to have knowledge of a breach if such breach is known or by exercising reasonable diligence would have been known, to any person, other than the person committing the breach, who is a workforce member or Partner of the organization. Following the discovery of a potential breach, the organization shall begin an investigation (see organizational policies for security incident response and/or risk management incident response) immediately, conduct a risk assessment, and based on the results of the risk assessment, begin the process to notify each Customer affected by the breach. Ovation shall also begin the process of determining what external notifications are required or should be made (e.g., Secretary of Department of Health \n Human Services (HHS), media outlets, law enforcement officials, etc.)\n\n\nBreach Investigation: The Ovation Security Officer shall name an individual to act as the investigator of the breach (e.g., privacy officer, security officer, risk manager, etc.).  The investigator shall be responsible for the management of the breach investigation, completion of a risk assessment, and coordinating with others in the organization as appropriate (e.g., administration, security incident response team, human resources, risk management, public relations, legal counsel, etc.) The investigator shall be the key facilitator for all breach notification processes to the appropriate entities (e.g., HHS, media, law enforcement officials, etc.).  All documentation related to the breach investigation, including the risk assessment, shall be retained for a minimum of six years. \n\n\nRisk Assessment: For an acquisition, access, use or disclosure of ePHI to constitute a breach, it must constitute a violation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. A use or disclosure of ePHI that is incident to an otherwise permissible use or disclosure that occurs despite reasonable safeguards and proper minimum necessary procedures would not be a violation of the Privacy Rule and would not qualify as a potential breach. To determine if an impermissible use or disclosure of ePHI constitutes a breach and requires further notification, the organization will need to perform a risk assessment to determine if there is significant risk of harm to the individual as a result of the impermissible use or disclosure. The organization shall document the risk assessment as part of the investigation in the incident report form noting the outcome of the risk assessment process. The organization has the burden of proof for demonstrating that all notifications to appropriate Customers or that the use or disclosure did not constitute a breach. Based on the outcome of the risk assessment, the organization will determine the need to move forward with breach notification. The risk assessment and the supporting documentation shall be fact specific and address:\n\n\nConsideration of who impermissibly used or to whom the information was impermissibly disclosed;\n\n\nThe type and amount of ePHI involved;\n\n\nThe cause of the breach, and the entity responsible for the breach, either Customer, Ovation, or Partner.\n\n\nThe potential for significant risk of financial, reputational, or other harm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeliness of Notification: Upon discovery of a breach, notice shall be made to the affected Ovation Customers no later than 24 hours after the discovery of the breach.

Breach notification will be carried out in compliance with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA)/Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) as well as any other federal or state notification law.  The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has published breach notification rules for vendors of personal health records as required by ARRA/HITECH. The FTC rule applies to entities not covered by HIPAA, primarily vendors of personal health records. The rule is effective September 24, 2009 with full compliance required by February 22, 2010.  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. Title XIII of ARRA is the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH). HITECH significantly impacts the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules.  While HIPAA did not require notification when patient protected health information (PHI) was inappropriately disclosed, covered entities and business associates may have chosen to include notification as part of the mitigation process. HITECH does require notification of certain breaches of unsecured PHI to the following: individuals, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the media. The effective implementation for this provision is September 23, 2009 (pending publication HHS regulations).  In the case of a breach, Ovation shall notify all affected Customers. It is the responsibility of the Customers to notify affected individuals.",

Ovation shall be deemed to have knowledge of a breach if such breach is known or by exercising reasonable diligence would have been known, to any person, other than the person committing the breach, who is a workforce member or Partner of the organization. Following the discovery of a potential breach, the organization shall begin an investigation (see organizational policies for security incident response and/or risk management incident response) immediately, conduct a risk assessment, and based on the results of the risk assessment, begin the process to notify each Customer affected by the breach. Ovation shall also begin the process of determining what external notifications are required or should be made (e.g., Secretary of Department of Health   Human Services (HHS), media outlets, law enforcement officials, etc.)  Breach Investigation: The Ovation Security Officer shall name an individual to act as the investigator of the breach (e.g., privacy officer, security officer, risk manager, etc.).  The investigator shall be responsible for the management of the breach investigation, completion of a risk assessment, and coordinating with others in the organization as appropriate (e.g., administration, security incident response team, human resources, risk management, public relations, legal counsel, etc.) The investigator shall be the key facilitator for all breach notification processes to the appropriate entities (e.g., HHS, media, law enforcement officials, etc.).  All documentation related to the breach investigation, including the risk assessment, shall be retained for a minimum of six years.   Risk Assessment: For an acquisition, access, use or disclosure of ePHI to constitute a breach, it must constitute a violation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. A use or disclosure of ePHI that is incident to an otherwise permissible use or disclosure that occurs despite reasonable safeguards and proper minimum necessary procedures would not be a violation of the Privacy Rule and would not qualify as a potential breach. To determine if an impermissible use or disclosure of ePHI constitutes a breach and requires further notification, the organization will need to perform a risk assessment to determine if there is significant risk of harm to the individual as a result of the impermissible use or disclosure. The organization shall document the risk assessment as part of the investigation in the incident report form noting the outcome of the risk assessment process. The organization has the burden of proof for demonstrating that all notifications to appropriate Customers or that the use or disclosure did not constitute a breach. Based on the outcome of the risk assessment, the organization will determine the need to move forward with breach notification. The risk assessment and the supporting documentation shall be fact specific and address:  Consideration of who impermissibly used or to whom the information was impermissibly disclosed;  The type and amount of ePHI involved;  The cause of the breach, and the entity responsible for the breach, either Customer, Ovation, or Partner.  The potential for significant risk of financial, reputational, or other harm.    Timeliness of Notification: Upon discovery of a breach, notice shall be made to the affected Ovation Customers no later than 24 hours after the discovery of the breach. It is the responsibility of the organization to demonstrate that all notifications were made as required, including evidence demonstrating the necessity of delay.  Delay of Notification Authorized for Law Enforcement Purposes:  If a law enforcement official states to the organization that a notification, notice, or posting would impede a criminal investigation or cause damage to national security, the organization shall:  If the statement is in writing and specifies the time for which a delay is required, delay such notification, notice, or posting of the time period specified by the official; or  If the statement is made orally, document the statement, including the identify of the official making the statement, and delay the notification, notice, or posting temporarily and no longer than 30 days from the date of the oral statement, unless a written statement as described above is submitted during that time.    Content of the Notice: The notice shall be written in plain language and must contain the following information:  A brief description of what happened, including the date of the breach and the date of the discovery of the breach, if known;  A description of the types of unsecured protected health information that were involved in the breach (such as whether full name, Social Security number, date of birth, home address, account number, diagnosis, disability code or other types of information were involved), if known;  Any steps the Customer should take to protect Customer data from potential harm resulting from the breach.  A brief description of what Ovation is doing to investigate the breach, to mitigate harm to individuals and Customers, and to protect against further breaches.  Contact procedures for individuals to ask questions or learn additional information, which may include a toll-free telephone number, an e-mail address, a web site, or postal address.    Methods of Notification: Ovation Customers will be notified via email and phone within the timeframe for reporting breaches, as outlined above.  Maintenance of Breach Information/Log: As described above and in addition to the reports created for each incident, Ovation shall maintain a process to record or log all breaches of unsecured ePHI regardless of the number of records and Customers affected. The following information should be collected/logged for each breach:   A description of what happened, including the date of the breach, the date of the discovery of the breach, and the number of records and Customers affected, if known.

Workforce Training: Ovation shall train all members of its workforce on the policies and procedures with respect to ePHI as necessary and appropriate for the members to carry out their job responsibilities. Workforce members shall also be trained as to how to identify and report breaches within the organization.  Complaints: Ovation must provide a process for individuals to make complaints concerning the organization\u2019s patient privacy policies and procedures or its compliance with such policies and procedures.  Sanctions: The organization shall have in place and apply appropriate sanctions against members of its workforce, Customers, and Partners who fail to comply with privacy policies and procedures.  Retaliation/Waiver: Ovation may not intimidate, threaten, coerce, discriminate against, or take other retaliatory action against any individual for the exercise by the individual of any privacy right.

Members of the team include personnel who are also responsible for the daily operations and maintenance of Ovation. The team leader is the Chief Architect and directs the Dev Ops Team.\n\n\nThe \nWeb Services Team\n is responsible for assuring all application servers, and web services are working. It is also responsible for testing redeployments and assessing damage to the environment. The team leader is the Chief Architect and directs the Web Services Team.\n\n\n\n\nTesting and Maintenance\n\n\nThe CTO and Chief Architect shall establish criteria for validation/testing of a Contingency Plan, an annual test schedule, and ensure implementation of the test. This process will also serve as training for personnel involved in the plan\u2019s execution. At a minimum the Contingency Plan shall be tested annually (within 365 days). The types of validation/testing exercises include tabletop and technical testing. Contingency Plans for all application systems must be tested at a minimum using the tabletop testing process. However, if the application system Contingency Plan is included in the technical testing of their respective support systems that technical test will satisfy the annual requirement.\n\n\nTabletop Testing\n\n\nTabletop Testing is conducted in accordance with the the CMS Risk Management Handbook, Volume 2 (http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/CMS-Information-Technology/InformationSecurity/Downloads/RMH_VII_4-5_Contingency_Plan_Exercise.pdf). The primary objective of the tabletop test is to ensure designated personnel are knowledgeable and capable of performing the notification/activation requirements and procedures as outlined in the CP, in a timely manner. The exercises include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n\n\nTesting to validate the ability to respond to a crisis in a coordinated, timely, and effective manner, by simulating the occurrence of a specific crisis.\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Testing\n\n\nThe primary objective of the technical test is to ensure the communication processes and data storage and recovery processes can function at an alternate site to perform the functions and capabilities of the system within the designated requirements. Technical testing shall include, but is not limited to:\n\n\n\n\nProcess from backup system at the alternate site;\n\n\nRestore system using backups; and\n\n\nSwitch compute and storage resources to alternate processing site.\n\n\n\n\n1. Notification and Activation Phase\n\n\nThis phase addresses the initial actions taken to detect and assess damage inflicted by a disruption to Ovation. Based on the assessment of the Event, sometimes according to the Ovation Incident Response Policy, the Contingency Plan may be activated by either the CTO or Chief Architect.\n\n\nThe notification sequence is listed below:\n\n\n\n\nThe first responder is to notify the CTO. All known information must be relayed to the CTO.\n\n\nThe Chief Architect is to contact the Web Services Team and inform them of the event. The CTO is to to begin assessment procedures.\n\n\nThe CTO is to notify team members and direct them to complete the assessment procedures outlined below to determine the extent of damage and estimated recovery time. If damage assessment cannot be performed locally because of unsafe conditions, the CTO is to follow the steps below.\n\n\nDamage Assessment Procedures:\n\n\nThe CTO and Chief Architect are to logically assess damage, gain insight into whether the infrastructure is salvageable, and begin to formulate a plan for recovery.\n\n\nAlternate Assessment Procedures:\n\n\nUpon notification from the CTO, the Chief Architect is to follow the procedures for damage assessment with combined DevOps and Web Services Teams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ovation Contingency Plan is to be activated if one or more of the following criteria are met:\n\n\n\n\nOvation will be unavailable for more than 48 hours.\n\n\nHosting facility is damaged and will be unavailable for more than 24 hours.\n\n\nOther criteria, as appropriate and as defined by Ovation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the plan is to be activated, the CTO is to notify and inform team members of the details of the event and if relocation is required.\n\n\n\n\nUpon notification from the CTO, group leaders and managers are to notify their respective teams. Team members are to be informed of all applicable information and prepared to respond and relocate if necessary.\n\n\nThe CTO is to notify the hosting facility partners that a contingency event has been declared and to ship the necessary materials (as determined by damage assessment) to the alternate site.\n\n\nThe CTO is to notify remaining personnel and executive leadership on the general status of the incident.\n\n\nNotification can be message, email, or phone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Recovery Phase\n\n\nThis section provides procedures for recovering the application at an alternate site, whereas other efforts are directed to repair damage to the original system and capabilities.\n\n\nThe following procedures are for recovering the Ovation infrastructure at the alternate site. Procedures are outlined per team required. Each procedure should be executed in the sequence it is presented to maintain efficient operations.\n\n\nRecovery Goal: The goal is to rebuild Ovation infrastructure to a production state.\n\n\nThe tasks outlines below are not sequential and some can be run in parallel.\n\n\n\n\nContact Partners and Customers affected - Web Services\n\n\nAssess damage to the environment - Web Services\n\n\nBegin replication of new environment using automated and tested scrips, currently Salt and/or AWS Elastic Beanstalk environments. A this point it is determined whether to recover in AWS or in Rackspace. - Dev Ops\n\n\nTest new environment using pre-written tests - Web Services\n\n\nTest logging, security, and alerting functionality - Dev Ops\n\n\nAssure systems are appropriately patched and up to date. - Dev Ops\n\n\nDeploy environment to production - Web Services\n\n\nUpdate DNS to new environment. - Dev Ops\n\n\n\n\n3. Reconstitution Phase\n\n\nThis section discusses activities necessary for restoring Ovation operations at the original or new site. The goal is to restore full operations within 24 hours of a disaster or outage. When the hosted data center at the original or new site has been restored, Ovation operations at the alternate site may be transitioned back. The goal is to provide a seamless transition of operations from the alternate site to the computer center.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal or New Site Restoration\n\n\n\n\nBegin replication of new environment using automated and tested scrips, currently Salt and/or AWS Elastic Beanstalk environments. - Dev Ops\n\n\nTest new environment using pre-written tests. - Web Services\n\n\nTest logging, security, and alerting functionality. - Dev Ops\n\n\nDeploy environment to production - Web Services\n\n\nAssure systems are appropriately patched and up to date. - Dev Ops\n\n\nUpdate DNS to new environment. - Dev Ops\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlan Deactivation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the Ovation environment is moved back to the original site from the alternative site, all hardware used at the alternate site should be handled and disposed of according to the Ovation Media Disposal Policy.",

The Chief Architect is to contact the Web Services Team and inform them of the event. The CTO is to to begin assessment procedures.  The CTO is to notify team members and direct them to complete the assessment procedures outlined below to determine the extent of damage and estimated recovery time. If damage assessment cannot be performed locally because of unsafe conditions, the CTO is to follow the steps below.  Damage Assessment Procedures:  The CTO and Chief Architect are to logically assess damage, gain insight into whether the infrastructure is salvageable, and begin to formulate a plan for recovery.  Alternate Assessment Procedures:  Upon notification from the CTO, the Chief Architect is to follow the procedures for damage assessment with combined DevOps and Web Services Teams.     The Ovation Contingency Plan is to be activated if one or more of the following criteria are met:   Ovation will be unavailable for more than 48 hours.  Hosting facility is damaged and will be unavailable for more than 24 hours.  Other criteria, as appropriate and as defined by Ovation.     If the plan is to be activated, the CTO is to notify and inform team members of the details of the event and if relocation is required.   Upon notification from the CTO, group leaders and managers are to notify their respective teams. Team members are to be informed of all applicable information and prepared to respond and relocate if necessary.  The CTO is to notify the hosting facility partners that a contingency event has been declared and to ship the necessary materials (as determined by damage assessment) to the alternate site.  The CTO is to notify remaining personnel and executive leadership on the general status of the incident.  Notification can be message, email, or phone.",

Any workforce member that violates this policy will be subject to disciplinary action based on the severity of the violation according to Ovation\u2019s policies, which is outlined in the Ovation Policy Management Policy.\n\n\nThe implementation, execution, and maintenance of the information security risk analysis and risk management process is the responsibility of Ovation\u2019s Security Officer (or other designated employee), and the identified Risk Management Team.\n\n\nAll risk management efforts, including decisions made on what controls to put in place as well as those to not put into place, are documented and the documentation is maintained for six years.\n\n\n\n\nRisk Management Procedures\n\n\nRisk Assessment\n: The intent of completing a risk assessment is to determine potential threats and vulnerabilities and the likelihood and impact should they occur. The output of this process helps to identify appropriate controls for reducing or eliminating risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1. System Characterization\n\n\n\n\nThe first step in assessing risk is to define the scope of the effort. To do this, identify where ePHI is received, maintained, processed, or transmitted. Using information-gathering techniques, the Ovation Platform boundaries are identified.\n\n\nOutput \u2013 Characterization of the Ovation Platform system assessed, a good picture of the Platform environment, and delineation of Platform boundaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2. Threat Identification\n\n\n\n\nPotential threats (the potential for threat-sources to successfully exercise a particular vulnerability) are identified and documented. All potential threat-sources through the review of historical incidents and data from intelligence agencies, the government, etc., to help generate a list of potential threats.\n\n\nOutput \u2013 A threat list containing a list of threat-sources that could exploit Platform vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. Vulnerability Identification\n\n\n\n\nDevelop a list of technical and non-technical Platform vulnerabilities that could be exploited or triggered by potential threat-sources. Vulnerabilities can range from incomplete or conflicting policies that govern an organization\u2019s computer usage to insufficient safeguards to protect facilities that house computer equipment to any number of software, hardware, or other deficiencies that comprise an organization\u2019s computer network.\n\n\nOutput \u2013 A list of the Platform vulnerabilities (observations) that could be exercised by potential threat-sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4. Control Analysis\n\n\n\n\nDocument and assess the effectiveness of technical and non-technical controls that have been or will be implemented by Ovation to minimize or eliminate the likelihood / probability of a threat-source exploiting a Platform vulnerability.\n\n\nOutput \u2013 List of current or planned controls (policies, procedures, training, technical mechanisms, insurance, etc.) used for the Platform to mitigate the likelihood of a vulnerability being exercised and reduce the impact of such an adverse event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5. Likelihood Determination\n\n\n\n\nDetermine the overall likelihood rating that indicates the probability that a vulnerability could be exploited by a threat-source given the existing or planned security controls.\n\n\nOutput \u2013 Likelihood rating of low (.1), medium (.5), or high (1). Refer to the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 6. Impact Analysis\n\n\n\n\nDetermine the level of adverse impact that would result from a threat successfully exploiting a vulnerability. Factors of the data and systems to consider should include the importance to Ovation's mission; sensitivity and criticality (value or importance); costs associated; loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and data.\n\n\nOutput \u2013 Magnitude of impact rating of low (10), medium (50), or high (100). Refer to the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 7. Risk Determination\n\n\n\n\nEstablish a risk level. By multiplying the ratings from the likelihood determination and impact analysis, a risk level is determined. This represents the degree or level of risk to which an IT system, facility, or procedure might be exposed if a given vulnerability were exercised. The risk rating also presents actions that senior management must take for each risk level.\n\n\nOutput \u2013 Risk level of low (1-10), medium (\n10-50) or high (\n50-100). Refer to the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 8. Control Recommendations\n\n\n\n\nIdentify controls that could reduce or eliminate the identified risks, as appropriate to the organization\u2019s operations to an acceptable level. Factors to consider when developing controls may include effectiveness of recommended options (i.e., system compatibility), legislation and regulation, organizational policy, operational impact, and safety and reliability. Control recommendations provide input to the risk mitigation process, during which the recommended procedural and technical security controls are evaluated, prioritized, and implemented.\n\n\nOutput \u2013 Recommendation of control(s) and alternative solutions to mitigate risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 9. Results Documentation\n\n\n\n\nResults of the risk assessment are documented in an official report, spreadsheet, or briefing and provided to senior management to make decisions on policy, procedure, budget, and Platform operational and management changes.\n\n\nOutput \u2013 A risk assessment report that describes the threats and vulnerabilities, measures the risk, and provides recommendations for control implementation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Mitigation\n: Risk mitigation involves prioritizing, evaluating, and implementing the appropriate risk-reducing controls recommended from the Risk Assessment process to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Ovation Platform ePHI. Determination of appropriate controls to reduce risk is dependent upon the risk tolerance of the organization consistent with its goals and mission. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1. Prioritize Actions\n\n\n\n\nUsing results from Step 7 of the Risk Assessment, sort the threat and vulnerability pairs according to their risk-levels in descending order. This establishes a prioritized list of actions needing to be taken, with the pairs at the top of the list getting/requiring the most immediate attention and top priority in allocating resources\n\n\nOutput \u2013 Actions ranked from high to low\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2. Evaluate Recommended Control Options\n\n\n\n\nAlthough possible controls for each threat and vulnerability pair are arrived at in Step 8 of the Risk Assessment, review the recommended control(s) and alternative solutions for reasonableness and appropriateness. The feasibility (e.g., compatibility, user acceptance, etc.) and effectiveness (e.g., degree of protection and level of risk mitigation) of the recommended controls should be analyzed. In the end, select a \u201cmost appropriate\u201d control option for each threat and vulnerability pair.\n\n\nOutput \u2013 list of feasible controls\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. Conduct Cost-Benefit Analysis\n\n\n\n\nDetermine the extent to which a control is cost-effective. Compare the benefit (e.g., risk reduction) of applying a control with its subsequent cost of application. Controls that are not cost-effective are also identified during this step. Analyzing each control or set of controls in this manner, and prioritizing across all controls being considered, can greatly aid in the decision-making process.\n\n\nOutput \u2013 Documented cost-benefit analysis of either implementing or not implementing each specific control\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4. Select Control(s)\n\n\n\n\nTaking into account the information and results from previous steps, Ovation\u2019s mission, and other important criteria, the Risk Management Team determines the best control(s) for reducing risks to the information systems and to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI. These controls may consist of a mix of administrative, physical, and/or technical safeguards.\n\n\nOutput \u2013 Selected control(s)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5. Assign Responsibility \n\n\n\n\nIdentify the workforce members with the skills necessary to implement each of the specific controls outlined in the previous step, and assign their responsibilities. Also identify the equipment, training and other resources needed for the successful implementation of controls. Resources may include time, money, equipment, etc.\n\n\nOutput \u2013 List of resources, responsible persons and their assignments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 6. Develop Safeguard Implementation Plan\n\n\n\n\nDevelop an overall implementation or action plan and individual project plans needed to implement the safeguards and controls identified. The Implementation Plan should contain the following information:\n\n\nEach risk or vulnerability/threat pair and risk level;\n\n\nPrioritized actions;\n\n\nThe recommended feasible control(s) for each identified risk;\n\n\nRequired resources for implementation of selected controls;\n\n\nTeam member responsible for implementation of each control;\n\n\nStart date for implementation\n\n\nTarget date for completion of implementation;\n\n\nMaintenance requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe overall implementation plan provides a broad overview of the safeguard implementation, identifying important milestones and timeframes, resource requirements (staff and other individuals\u2019 time, budget, etc.), interrelationships between projects, and any other relevant information. Regular status reporting of the plan, along with key metrics and success indicators should be reported to Ovation Senior Management.\n\n\nIndividual project plans for safeguard implementation may be developed and contain detailed steps that resources assigned carry out to meet implementation timeframes and expectations. Additionally, consider including items in individual project plans such as a project scope, a list deliverables, key assumptions, objectives, task completion dates and project requirements.\n\n\nOutput \u2013 Safeguard Implementation Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 7. Implement Selected Controls\n\n\n\n\nAs controls are implemented, monitor the affected system(s) to verify that the implemented controls continue to meet expectations. Elimination of all risk is not practical. Depending on individual situations, implemented controls may lower a risk level but not completely eliminate the risk.\n\n\nContinually and consistently communicate expectations to all Risk Management Team members, as well as senior management and other key people throughout the risk mitigation process. Identify when new risks are identified and when controls lower or offset risk rather than eliminate it.\n\n\nAdditional monitoring is especially crucial during times of major environmental changes, organizational or process changes, or major facilities changes.\n\n\nIf risk reduction expectations are not met, then repeat all or a part of the risk management process so that additional controls needed to lower risk to an acceptable level can be identified.\n\n\nOutput \u2013 Residual Risk documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Management Schedule\n: The two principle components of the risk management process - risk assessment and risk mitigation - will be carried out according to the following schedule to ensure the continued adequacy and continuous improvement of Ovation\u2019s information security program:\n\n\n\n\nScheduled Basis \u2013 an overall risk assessment of Ovation\u2019s information system infrastructure will be conducted annually. The assessment process should be completed in a timely fashion so that risk mitigation strategies can be determined and included in the corporate budgeting process.\n\n\nThroughout a System\u2019s Development Life Cycle \u2013 from the time that a need for a new, untested information system configuration and/or application is identified through the time it is disposed of, ongoing assessments of the potential threats to a system and its vulnerabilities should be undertaken as a part of the maintenance of the system.\n\n\nAs Needed \u2013 the Security Officer (or other designated employee) or Risk Management Team may call for a full or partial risk assessment in response to changes in business strategies, information technology, information sensitivity, threats, legal liabilities, or other significant factors that affect Ovation\u2019s Platform.\n\n\n\n\nProcess Documentation\n\n\nMaintain documentation of all risk assessment, risk management, and risk mitigation efforts for a minimum of six years.",

Risk assessments are done throughout product life cycles:   Before the integration of new system technologies and before changes are made to Ovation physical safeguards; and  These changes do not include routine updates to existing systems, deployments of new systems created based on previously configured systems, deployments of new Customers, or new code developed for operations and management of the Ovation Platform.    While making changes to Ovation physical equipment and facilities that introduce new, untested configurations.  Ovation performs periodic technical and non-technical assessments of the security rule requirements as well as in response to environmental or operational changes affecting the security of ePHI.    Ovation implements security measures sufficient to reduce risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level to:  Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all ePHI Ovation receives, maintains, processes, and/or transmits for its Customers;  Protect against any reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of Customer ePHI;  Protect against any reasonably anticipated uses or disclosures of Customer ePHI that are not permitted or required; and  Ensure compliance by all workforce members.    Any risk remaining (residual) after other risk controls have been applied, requires sign off by the senior management and Ovation\u2019s Security Officer.  All Ovation workforce members are expected to fully cooperate with all persons charged with doing risk management work, including contractors and audit personnel. Any workforce member that violates this policy will be subject to disciplinary action based on the severity of the violation according to Ovation\u2019s policies, which is outlined in the Ovation Policy Management Policy.  The implementation, execution, and maintenance of the information security risk analysis and risk management process is the responsibility of Ovation\u2019s Security Officer (or other designated employee), and the identified Risk Management Team.  All risk management efforts, including decisions made on what controls to put in place as well as those to not put into place, are documented and the documentation is maintained for six years.",

            "text": "Risk Assessment : The intent of completing a risk assessment is to determine potential threats and vulnerabilities and the likelihood and impact should they occur. The output of this process helps to identify appropriate controls for reducing or eliminating risk.    Step 1. System Characterization   The first step in assessing risk is to define the scope of the effort. To do this, identify where ePHI is received, maintained, processed, or transmitted. Using information-gathering techniques, the Ovation Platform boundaries are identified.  Output \u2013 Characterization of the Ovation Platform system assessed, a good picture of the Platform environment, and delineation of Platform boundaries.     Step 2. Threat Identification   Potential threats (the potential for threat-sources to successfully exercise a particular vulnerability) are identified and documented. All potential threat-sources through the review of historical incidents and data from intelligence agencies, the government, etc., to help generate a list of potential threats.  Output \u2013 A threat list containing a list of threat-sources that could exploit Platform vulnerabilities.     Step 3. Vulnerability Identification   Develop a list of technical and non-technical Platform vulnerabilities that could be exploited or triggered by potential threat-sources. Vulnerabilities can range from incomplete or conflicting policies that govern an organization\u2019s computer usage to insufficient safeguards to protect facilities that house computer equipment to any number of software, hardware, or other deficiencies that comprise an organization\u2019s computer network.  Output \u2013 A list of the Platform vulnerabilities (observations) that could be exercised by potential threat-sources.     Step 4. Control Analysis   Document and assess the effectiveness of technical and non-technical controls that have been or will be implemented by Ovation to minimize or eliminate the likelihood / probability of a threat-source exploiting a Platform vulnerability.  Output \u2013 List of current or planned controls (policies, procedures, training, technical mechanisms, insurance, etc.) used for the Platform to mitigate the likelihood of a vulnerability being exercised and reduce the impact of such an adverse event.     Step 5. Likelihood Determination   Determine the overall likelihood rating that indicates the probability that a vulnerability could be exploited by a threat-source given the existing or planned security controls.  Output \u2013 Likelihood rating of low (.1), medium (.5), or high (1). Refer to the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high.     Step 6. Impact Analysis   Determine the level of adverse impact that would result from a threat successfully exploiting a vulnerability. Factors of the data and systems to consider should include the importance to Ovation's mission; sensitivity and criticality (value or importance); costs associated; loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and data.  Output \u2013 Magnitude of impact rating of low (10), medium (50), or high (100). Refer to the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high.     Step 7. Risk Determination   Establish a risk level. By multiplying the ratings from the likelihood determination and impact analysis, a risk level is determined. This represents the degree or level of risk to which an IT system, facility, or procedure might be exposed if a given vulnerability were exercised. The risk rating also presents actions that senior management must take for each risk level.  Output \u2013 Risk level of low (1-10), medium ( 10-50) or high ( 50-100). Refer to the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high.     Step 8. Control Recommendations   Identify controls that could reduce or eliminate the identified risks, as appropriate to the organization\u2019s operations to an acceptable level. Factors to consider when developing controls may include effectiveness of recommended options (i.e., system compatibility), legislation and regulation, organizational policy, operational impact, and safety and reliability. Control recommendations provide input to the risk mitigation process, during which the recommended procedural and technical security controls are evaluated, prioritized, and implemented.  Output \u2013 Recommendation of control(s) and alternative solutions to mitigate risk.     Step 9. Results Documentation   Results of the risk assessment are documented in an official report, spreadsheet, or briefing and provided to senior management to make decisions on policy, procedure, budget, and Platform operational and management changes.  Output \u2013 A risk assessment report that describes the threats and vulnerabilities, measures the risk, and provides recommendations for control implementation.     Risk Mitigation : Risk mitigation involves prioritizing, evaluating, and implementing the appropriate risk-reducing controls recommended from the Risk Assessment process to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Ovation Platform ePHI. Determination of appropriate controls to reduce risk is dependent upon the risk tolerance of the organization consistent with its goals and mission.     Step 1. Prioritize Actions   Using results from Step 7 of the Risk Assessment, sort the threat and vulnerability pairs according to their risk-levels in descending order. This establishes a prioritized list of actions needing to be taken, with the pairs at the top of the list getting/requiring the most immediate attention and top priority in allocating resources  Output \u2013 Actions ranked from high to low     Step 2. Evaluate Recommended Control Options   Although possible controls for each threat and vulnerability pair are arrived at in Step 8 of the Risk Assessment, review the recommended control(s) and alternative solutions for reasonableness and appropriateness. The feasibility (e.g., compatibility, user acceptance, etc.) and effectiveness (e.g., degree of protection and level of risk mitigation) of the recommended controls should be analyzed. In the end, select a \u201cmost appropriate\u201d control option for each threat and vulnerability pair.  Output \u2013 list of feasible controls     Step 3. Conduct Cost-Benefit Analysis   Determine the extent to which a control is cost-effective. Compare the benefit (e.g., risk reduction) of applying a control with its subsequent cost of application. Controls that are not cost-effective are also identified during this step. Analyzing each control or set of controls in this manner, and prioritizing across all controls being considered, can greatly aid in the decision-making process.  Output \u2013 Documented cost-benefit analysis of either implementing or not implementing each specific control     Step 4. Select Control(s)   Taking into account the information and results from previous steps, Ovation\u2019s mission, and other important criteria, the Risk Management Team determines the best control(s) for reducing risks to the information systems and to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI. These controls may consist of a mix of administrative, physical, and/or technical safeguards.  Output \u2013 Selected control(s)     Step 5. Assign Responsibility    Identify the workforce members with the skills necessary to implement each of the specific controls outlined in the previous step, and assign their responsibilities. Also identify the equipment, training and other resources needed for the successful implementation of controls. Resources may include time, money, equipment, etc.  Output \u2013 List of resources, responsible persons and their assignments     Step 6. Develop Safeguard Implementation Plan   Develop an overall implementation or action plan and individual project plans needed to implement the safeguards and controls identified. The Implementation Plan should contain the following information:  Each risk or vulnerability/threat pair and risk level;  Prioritized actions;  The recommended feasible control(s) for each identified risk;  Required resources for implementation of selected controls;  Team member responsible for implementation of each control;  Start date for implementation  Target date for completion of implementation;  Maintenance requirements.    The overall implementation plan provides a broad overview of the safeguard implementation, identifying important milestones and timeframes, resource requirements (staff and other individuals\u2019 time, budget, etc.), interrelationships between projects, and any other relevant information. Regular status reporting of the plan, along with key metrics and success indicators should be reported to Ovation Senior Management.  Individual project plans for safeguard implementation may be developed and contain detailed steps that resources assigned carry out to meet implementation timeframes and expectations. Additionally, consider including items in individual project plans such as a project scope, a list deliverables, key assumptions, objectives, task completion dates and project requirements.  Output \u2013 Safeguard Implementation Plan     Step 7. Implement Selected Controls   As controls are implemented, monitor the affected system(s) to verify that the implemented controls continue to meet expectations. Elimination of all risk is not practical. Depending on individual situations, implemented controls may lower a risk level but not completely eliminate the risk.  Continually and consistently communicate expectations to all Risk Management Team members, as well as senior management and other key people throughout the risk mitigation process. Identify when new risks are identified and when controls lower or offset risk rather than eliminate it.  Additional monitoring is especially crucial during times of major environmental changes, organizational or process changes, or major facilities changes.  If risk reduction expectations are not met, then repeat all or a part of the risk management process so that additional controls needed to lower risk to an acceptable level can be identified.  Output \u2013 Residual Risk documentation     Risk Management Schedule : The two principle components of the risk management process - risk assessment and risk mitigation - will be carried out according to the following schedule to ensure the continued adequacy and continuous improvement of Ovation\u2019s information security program:   Scheduled Basis \u2013 an overall risk assessment of Ovation\u2019s information system infrastructure will be conducted annually. The assessment process should be completed in a timely fashion so that risk mitigation strategies can be determined and included in the corporate budgeting process.  Throughout a System\u2019s Development Life Cycle \u2013 from the time that a need for a new, untested information system configuration and/or application is identified through the time it is disposed of, ongoing assessments of the potential threats to a system and its vulnerabilities should be undertaken as a part of the maintenance of the system.  As Needed \u2013 the Security Officer (or other designated employee) or Risk Management Team may call for a full or partial risk assessment in response to changes in business strategies, information technology, information sensitivity, threats, legal liabilities, or other significant factors that affect Ovation\u2019s Platform.",

This BAA supplements the other terms and conditions that apply between Customer and Ovation, which are detailed or referenced in the \nTerms of Service\n applicable to the Service.\n\n\nThis BAA is intended to ensure that Business Associate and Customer will establish and implement appropriate safeguards where Business Associate may receive, create, maintain, use or disclose PHI in connection with the functions, activities and services that Business Associate performs on behalf of Customer solely to perform its duties and responsibilities under the Services Agreement (the Services).\n\n\n2.   APPLICABILITY.\n\n\nCustomer and Business Associate agree that this BAA applies solely with respect to the Services that Business Associate performs on Customer's behalf under the Services Agreement, and does not apply to any other purpose for which Business Associate may create, receive, access, use, maintain or disclose Protected Health Information or Electronic Protected Health Information.\n\n\n3.   DEFINITIONS.\n\n\n\n\nIndividual\n shall have the same meaning as the term \u201cindividual\u201d in 45 CFR \u00a7160.103 and shall include a person who qualifies as a personal representative in accordance with 45 CFR \u00a7164.502(g).\n\n\nRequired By Law\n shall have the same meaning as the term \u201crequired by law\u201d in 45 CFR \u00a7164.103.\n\n\nServices Agreement\n shall mean the Contract between Ovation and Customer, taken together with the Terms of Service.\n\n\nCapitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Terms of Service or HIPAA, as the case may be.\n\n\n\n\n4.   PERMITTED AND REQUIRED USES AND DISCLOSURES.\n\n\na.    \nService Offerings.\n Business Associate may use or disclose PHI in connection with the performance of the Services if such use or disclosure of PHI would not violate HIPAA if done by Customer or if such use or disclosure is expressly permitted under this BAA or the Services Agreement.  \n\n\nb.    \nAdministration and Management of Services.\n Business Associate may use or disclose PHI received by Business Associate in its capacity as \"business associate\" of Customer for the proper management and administration of Business Associate.  Any such disclosure of PHI shall only be made if Business Associate obtains reasonable assurances from the person to whom the PHI is disclosed that: (1) the PHI will be held confidentially and used or further disclosed only as required by law or for the purpose for which it was disclosed to the person; (2) Business Associate will be notified by such person of any instances of which it becomes aware in which the confidentiality of the PHI has been breached; and (3) the person will provide Business Associate appropriate notice and opportunity to object before disclosing PHI on the basis that such disclosure is required by law.\n\n\nc.    \nDisclosures Required By Law.\n  Business Associate may only use or disclose PHI on the basis that such disclosure is required by law after notifying Customer\u2019s Privacy Officer or his/her designee to allow an opportunity to object to the disclosure and to seek appropriate relief.  If Customer objects to such disclosure, Business Associate shall, to the extent legally permitted, refrain from disclosing the PHI until Customer has exhausted all alternatives for relief.  However, if Business Associate is unable to notify Customer for reasons beyond Business Associate\u2019s control, Business Associate may disclose PHI on the basis that such disclosure is required by law so long as Business Associate provides immediate notice to Customer\u2019s Privacy Officer or his/her designee following the disclosure.\n\n\nd.    \nDisclosure to Subcontractors.\n  Business Associate shall ensure that any subcontractors that create, receive, maintain or transmit PHI on behalf of Business Associate agree, in a writing that complies with the requirements of 45 C.F.R. \u00a7164.504(e)(2) through (e)(4), to be bound by the same restrictions and conditions that apply to Business Associate under this BAA with respect to such PHI, including, without limitation, implementing reasonable and appropriate safeguards to protect it.  \n\n\ne.    Data Aggregation.  To the extent permitted by the Services Agreement, or as otherwise expressly agreed to in writing by Customer, Business Associate may use and disclose PHI for data aggregation purposes, however, only in order to analyze data for permitted health care operations of Customer, and only to the extent that such use is permitted under HIPAA.\n\n\n5.   OBLIGATIONS OF BUSINESS ASSOCIATE.\n\n\na.    \nLimit on Uses and Disclosures.\n Business Associate will use and disclose PHI only as permitted by this BAA or as Required By Law.  If Customer notifies Business Associate that Customer has agreed to be bound by additional restrictions on the uses or disclosures of PHI pursuant to HIPAA, Business Associate and Customer shall mutually agree on the extent to which Business Associate will be bound by such additional restrictions and Business Associate shall not disclose PHI in violation of such additional mutually agreed upon restrictions.\n\n\nb.    \nSafeguards.\n Business Associate will use reasonable and appropriate safeguards to prevent Use or Disclosure of PHI other than as provided for by this BAA, consistent with the requirements of Subpart C of 45 C.F.R. Part 164 (with respect to Electronic PHI) as determined by Business Associate.\n\n\nc.    \nReporting of Impermissible Uses and Disclosures.\n Business Associate will report to Customer any Use or Disclosure of PHI not permitted or required by this BAA of which Business Associate becomes aware.\n\n\nd.    \nReporting of Security Incidents.\n Business Associate will report to Customer no less than fourteen (14) business days from the date Business Associate becomes aware of any Security Incidents involving PHI in which there is a successful unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction of information or interference with system operations in an Information System in a manner that risks the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of such information. Notice is hereby deemed provided, and no further notice will be provided, for unsuccessful attempts at such unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction, such as pings and other broadcast attacks on a firewall, denial of service attacks, port scans, unsuccessful login attempts, or interception of encrypted information where the key is not compromised, or any combination of the above.\n\n\ne.    \nReporting of Breaches.\n Business Associate will report to Customer any Breach of Customer\u2019s Unsecured PHI that Business Associate may discover to the extent required by 45 C.F.R. \u00a7164.410. Business Associate will make such report without unreasonable delay, and in no case later than four (4) hours after discovery by Business Associate of such Breach. Business Associate undertakes no obligation to report network security related incidents which occur on its managed network but do not directly involve Customer\u2019s use of the Services.\n\n\nf.    \nAccounting of Disclosures.\n Business Associate will make available to Customer the information required to provide an accounting of Disclosures in accordance with 45 C.F.R. \u00a7164.528 of which Business Associate is aware, if requested by Customer.\n\n\ng.    \nInternal Records.\n Business Associate will make its internal practices, books, and records relating to the Use and Disclosure of PHI available to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for purposes of determining Customer compliance with HIPAA. Nothing in this section will waive any applicable privilege or protection, including with respect to trade secrets and confidential commercial information.\n\n\n6.   CUSTOMER\u2019S OBLIGATIONS.\n\n\na.    \nAppropriate Use of HIPAA Accounts.\n At all times, Customer will comply with the Privacy Rules, Security Rules and other applicable laws and regulations.  By way of illustration and not limitation, Customer is responsible for implementing appropriate privacy and security safeguards in order to protect PHI in compliance with HIPAA and this BAA and Customer shall not include PHI in any Services that are not or cannot be HIPAA compliant.\n\n\nb.    \nNecessary Consents.\n Customer warrants that it has obtained all necessary authorizations, consents, and other permissions from the Individuals (or their personal representatives), in the form and to the extent required by the Privacy Rules, that may be required under applicable law for Business Associate to use and disclose their PHI in the manner and for the purposes described in this BAA and the Services Agreement.  Customer will promptly notify Business Associate of any changes in, or withdrawal of, such written permission provided to Customer by Individuals or their personal representatives, including without limitation revocations of authorizations pursuant to 45 CFR \u00a7164.508.  Customer will also promptly notify Business Associate of any restrictions to the use and disclosure of PHI that Customer has agreed to in accordance with 45 CFR \u00a7164.522, to the extent that such restrictions affect Business Associate\u2019s use or disclosure of PHI.\n\n\nc.    \nRestrictions on Disclosures.\n Customer shall not agree to any request for restrictions or place any restrictions in any notice of its privacy practices that would cause Business Associate to violate this BAA, the Services Agreement or any applicable law.\n\n\nd.    \nCompliance with HIPAA.\n Customer shall not request or cause Business Associate to make a Use or Disclosure of PHI in a manner that does not comply with this BAA, the Services Agreement, HIPAA or any other applicable law.\n\n\ne.    \nPrivacy Practices.\n Customer will provide Business Associate with a copy of the notice of privacy practices that it provides to Individuals (or their personal representatives) who are the subject of the PHI.\n\n\nf.    \nIdentity of Users.\n The Services include means by which Customer's Users may be permitted to import, export, review and exchange PHI.  Therefore, Customer shall implement and comply with reasonable policies and methods to confirm and verify the actual identity of Users that will be registered to access and use the Services under its Account.\n\n\n7.   TERM AND TERMINATION.\n\n\na.    \nTerm.\n The term of this BAA will commence on the BAA Effective Date and will remain in effect until the termination of the Contract.\n\n\nb.    \nEffect of Termination.\n At termination of this BAA, Business Associate, if feasible, will return or destroy all PHI that Business Associate still maintains, if any. If return or destruction is not feasible, Business Associate will extend the protections of this BAA to the PHI, limit further uses and disclosures to those purposes that make the return of the PHI infeasible, and make no further use or disclosure of PHI.\n\n\nc.    \nAccount Access.\n If Customer requests contemporaneously with any termination event or notice, Business Associate will allow Customer to have access to Customer\u2019s Account for a reasonable period of time following termination as necessary for Customer to retrieve or delete any PHI at its then current monthly recurring rate; provided, however, that if the security of Customer\u2019s servers has been compromised, or the Services Agreement was terminated by Customer\u2019s failure to use reasonable security precautions, Business Associate may: (i) provide Customer with restricted access via a dedicated or private link or tunnel to Customer Account or (ii) refuse to allow Customer to have access to Customer\u2019s Account but will use reasonable efforts to copy Service Data onto media Customer provides to Business Associate, and will ship the media to Customer at Customer's risk and expense. Business Associate\u2019s efforts to copy Service Data onto Customer-supplied media shall be billable as an Additional Service at Business Associate\u2019s then current hourly rates.\n\n\nd.    \nDe-identification.\n Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Business Associate may de-identify some or all of the PHI, in which case Business Associate may retain, use and disclose such de-identified PHI for the purposes described in the Services Agreement (including without limitation, for Analytics).  For clarity, any PHI that is de-identified shall cease to be PHI for the purposes of this BAA and Business Associate will have no further obligation with respect to such information and data under this BAA.\n\n\n8.   MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n\na.    \nAmendment.\n Customer and Business Associate agrees to take such action as is reasonably necessary to amend this BAA from time to time as is necessary for either party to comply with the requirements of the Privacy Rule and related laws and regulations.\n\n\nb.    \nSurvival.\n Customer and Business Associate\u2019s respective rights and obligations under Sections 7(b) - (d) of this BAA shall survive the termination of the Services Agreement.\n\n\nc.    \nInterpretation.\n Any ambiguity in the Services Agreement shall be resolved to permit Business Associate and the Customer to comply with HIPAA and the Privacy Rule.\n\n\nd.    \nEntire Agreement.\n This BAA constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior negotiations, understandings or agreements (oral or written), between the parties regarding the subject matter hereof.  All notices under this BAA will be in writing and delivered to the parties at their respective addresses as provided in the Services Agreement.  Neither party shall be liable for any delay or failure in performing its obligations hereunder that arises out of any cause, condition or circumstance beyond its reasonable control.  Nothing in this BAA confers upon any person other than the parties (and their respective successors and permitted assigns) any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities whatsoever.",

Ovation may use online hosting services (such as, for example, Google Cloud Platform) in connection with providing the Service (including without limitation, for the purposes of processing and storing Service Data).\n\n\nService Data\n means all data and data sets (other than Customer Data) that Ovation makes available to Customer pursuant to access and use of the Service and as specified under these Terms of Service.\n\n\nSource\n means any laboratory, company, or other organization or entity that provides or has provided data to Ovation.\n\n\nStatement of Work\n means any written work statement that references these Terms of Service and that is acceptable to and executed by Customer and Ovation, and which will include other information related to the Work (such as, for example, professional services descriptions, schedules and payments).\n\n\nUser\n means each of the named individuals who is specifically identified by Customer for onboarding and use of the Service under Customer's Account.\n\n\n3. SERVICE.\n\n\nLicense.\n So long as the Service is provided to Customer and subject to compliance with all Terms of Service, Ovation will make the Service available to Customer and hereby grants to Customer a nonexclusive, non-transferable, revocable right and license: to access and use the Service through a web-based interface; and to permit identified Users to do the same under its Account. The Ovation IP, including, in particular, the Service Data, may be used only in unmodified form and solely for Customer's internal business purposes. Customer's and Users' access and use of the Ovation IP, including, in particular, the Service Data, shall comply with all other conditions that may be set forth in these Terms of Service or the Contract (such as, for example, restrictions regarding the number or identity of authorized Users, data formats, size limits, time limits or prohibited uses). From time to time, Customer and Users may (at their discretion) provide Feedback to Ovation.\n\n\nAccount.\n Ovation will provide Customer with access credentials (and/or a mechanism that permits Customer to specify access credentials) as needed to identify, authorize and designate roles for Users who will have rights (as appropriate to their roles) to establish, administer, configure, manage and use the Service through a Customer-specific account ( Account ). Customer and Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of all Account information (including access credentials). Customer agrees to be liable for all activities under its Account. Customer and Users agree to keep all Account information up-to-date and to notify Ovation immediately of any unauthorized use of their Account. Customer shall promptly notify Ovation of Users who are no longer permitted to access and use the Service under Customer's Account. Customer shall implement and comply with reasonable policies and methods to confirm and verify the actual identity of Users that will be registered to access and use the Service under its Account.\n\n\nResources.\n Sources are solely responsible for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of Service Data that they provide, and for acquiring all consents, authorizations, permissions and other rights necessary for Ovation to receive, access, copy, store, process, distribute, transmit, display and use Service Data in de-identified and aggregated form pursuant to HIPAA and as provided in these Terms of Service. Customers are solely responsible for all servers, storage, software, databases, network and communications systems and services needed by Customer and Users to access, manage and use the Service and Service Data, and backup, recovery, network security and maintenance services for Customer's and Users' internal systems (collectively, the Customer Resources ).\n\n\nSharing Service Data.\n Ovation does not review the substance of Service Data and does not control the use of Service Data that has been provided to Ovation. Authentication of the true identity of Internet users is difficult, and so Ovation cannot and does not confirm that any user in the provenance of Service Data is the person or entity who they claim to be. Accordingly, Ovation makes no representation or warranty, and assumes no liability, regarding the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability or appropriateness of any such Service Data. Customer and its Users agree to assume all risk and liability arising from (a) sharing their own, if any, results derived from use of the Service Data (including any further distribution or use for an unintended purpose) and (b) using Service Data (including any and all results that are generated using such Service Data).\n\n\nSupport Services.\n Using commercially reasonable efforts, Ovation will: assist Customer to access, configure, verify and commence User operation of the Service under its Account; provide ongoing technical support for the Service (telephone, email or web-based), in accordance with its standard practices during normal business hours; and endeavor to analyze and resolve material errors. Ovation has no obligation to operate or support any version of the Service other than the then current version. Ovation may charge Customer in accordance with its then current policies for support services that result from problems, errors or inquiries related to the Customer Resources.\n\n\nAdditional Services.\n From time to time, Customer may request and Ovation may agree to provide certain additional implementation, integration, data analysis, development, training or other professional services related to the Service ( Work ). Ovation agrees to undertake and use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the Work as described in the corresponding Statement of Work. Ovation grants Customer a nonexclusive, nontransferable right and license (without right to sublicense) to use the resulting Deliverables solely in conjunction with authorized use of the Service, subject to the terms of these Terms of Service and other rights or restrictions set forth in the Statement of Work.\n\n\nThird Party Services.\n Certain applications, platforms and services provided by third parties (collectively, Third Party Services ) may be accessed from the Service. Third Party Services are not operated or controlled by Ovation, and Ovation shall not be responsible for the availability, accuracy or any other aspect of the content or function of Third Party Services. Additional or different terms and conditions (including without limitation, privacy and security practices) apply to the use of Third Party Services, and Customer and each User hereby agrees to comply with such terms and conditions when using Third Party Services.\n\n\nCompliance.\n If applicable, Customer, Users and Ovation agree to comply with all federal, state and local laws, regulations and rules (including without limitation, HIPAA, the Physician Self-Referral Law (42 USC 1395nn), the federal Medicare/Medicaid Anti-Kickback Law and regulations promulgated thereunder). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is neither a purpose nor requirement of these Terms of Service, the Contract or any other agreement between the parties to offer or receive any remuneration or benefit of any nature, to solicit, require, induce or encourage the referral of any patient, payment of which may be made in whole or in part by Medicare or Medicaid. No payment made or received under these Terms of Service is in return for the referral of patients or in return for the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchasing, leasing or ordering of any good, service, item or product for which payment may be made in whole or in part under Medicare or Medicaid.\n\n\n4. PAYMENTS.\n\n\nFees.\n Customer shall pay Ovation the fees described in the Contract and each Statement of Work, in the amounts and at the times set forth therein, and as otherwise stated in these Terms of Service. Fees may be specified as being payable in advance or in arrears; fees may be fixed, contingent or variable (e.g., depending on usage factors or per sample charges); and fees may be specified on a recurring basis (e.g., subscription fees and/or usage fees, which may be payable monthly, quarterly or annually) or non-recurring basis (e.g., one-time activation fees).\n\n\nRecurring Fees.\n Recurring fees (e.g., subscription fees and/or usage fees) must be paid by an automatic payment method (credit card or ACH bank transfer) which may be stored. Generally, recurring fees will be automatically charged on such stored payment method 15 days following invoicing. Customer will receive an invoice (by email) of all recurring fees (whether from Ovation or from a partner of Ovation) for current billing period. By choosing a plan with recurring fees, Customer acknowledges that such recurring fees have an initial and recurring payment feature and Customer accepts responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. OVATION MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM CUSTOMER, UNTIL CUSTOMER PROVIDES PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH WILL BE CONFIRMED IN WRITING BY OVATION) THAT CUSTOMER HAS TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISHES TO CHANGE CUSTOMER'S PAYMENT METHOD. SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE OVATION REASONABLY COULD ACT. CUSTOMER MAY TERMINATE ITS AUTHORIZATION OR CHANGE ITS PAYMENT METHOD, BY VISITING CUSTOMER'S ACCOUNT SETTINGS ON THE SITE. Customer hereby accepts all credit card or ACH payment charges that comply with these Terms of Service.\n\n\nPayment Terms.\n Ovation may collect payments from Customer directly or use a third-party payment processor ( Payment Processor ) to bill Customer through a payment account linked to Customer's Account for use of the Service. The processing of payments by a Payment Processor will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of such Payment Processor in addition to these Terms of Service and the Contract or applicable Statement of Work. Ovation shall not be responsible for error by the Payment Processor. Unless specified otherwise, all amounts due hereunder shall be paid in full (without deduction, set-off or counterclaim) within 15 days after invoice in US dollars at Ovation's address or to an account specified by Ovation. Past due amounts shall bear a late payment charge, until paid, at the rate of 1.0% per month or the maximum amount permitted by law, whichever is less. If any payment is past due, Ovation shall have the right to take whatever action it deems appropriate (including without limitation, disabling the Account, suspending User access to the Service, or terminating the Contract pursuant to Section 10). Without limiting the foregoing, if Ovation, through the Payment Processor, does not receive payment from Customer, Customer agrees to pay all amounts due on its Account upon demand. Customer agrees to reimburse Ovation for all costs (including attorneys' fees) incurred in collecting late payments.\n\n\nTaxes.\n All payments required by these Terms of Service are exclusive of federal, state, local and foreign taxes, duties, tariffs, levies, withholdings and similar assessments (including without limitation, sales taxes, use taxes and value added taxes), and Customer agrees to bear and be responsible for the payment of all such charges, excluding taxes based upon Ovation's net income. All amounts due hereunder shall be grossed-up for any withholding taxes imposed by any foreign government. If Customer claims exemption from any tax, then it shall furnish Ovation with a valid tax exemption certificate issued by or acceptable to the applicable taxing jurisdiction or entity.\n\n\nCurrent Billing Information Required.\n CUSTOMER MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE BILLING INFORMATION FOR ITS ACCOUNT. CUSTOMER MUST PROMPTLY UPDATE ALL RELEVANT INFORMATION TO KEEP ITS ACCOUNT CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING ADDRESS, CREDIT CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE), AND CUSTOMER MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY OVATION OR THE PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF CUSTOMER'S PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF CUSTOMER BECOMES AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF A USER NAME OR PASSWORD. CHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE MADE AT CUSTOMER'S ACCOUNT SETTINGS ON THE SITE. IF CUSTOMER FAILS TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, CUSTOMER AGREES THAT OVATION MAY CONTINUE CHARGING CUSTOMER FOR ANY RECURRING FEES UNDER CUSTOMER'S BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS CUSTOMER HAS TERMINATED OR CANCELED ITS USE OF THE SERVICE.\n\n\n5. CONFIDENTIALITY.\n\n\nScope.\n The term Confidential Information means all trade secrets, know-how, inventions, software and other financial, business, scientific, clinical or technical information and data disclosed by or for a party in connection with using or providing the Service. The restrictions on use and disclosure of Confidential Information will not apply to any information or data that the receiving party can demonstrate is (a) rightfully furnished to it without restriction by a third party, (b) generally available to the public without breach of these Terms of Service or (c) independently developed by it without reliance on such information or data. For clarity, all Service Data, Feedback, Ovation IP and pricing information will be treated as Ovation's Confidential Information.\n\n\nConfidentiality.\n Except for the specific rights granted by these Terms of Service, and except for disclosures that are necessary to comply with any legal, regulatory, law enforcement or similar requirement or investigation, the receiving party shall not access, reproduce, use or disclose any of the other party's Confidential Information without its written consent, and shall use reasonable care to protect the other's Confidential Information from unauthorized access, use and disclosure (including by ensuring that its personnel who access any Confidential Information have a need to know for the permitted purpose and are bound by written obligations that are at least as protective as these Terms of Service). Each party shall be responsible for any breach of confidentiality by its personnel (including Users, in the case of Customer). Promptly after any termination (or at the disclosing party's request at any other time), the receiving party shall return all of the other's tangible Confidential Information, permanently erase all Confidential Information from any storage media and destroy all information, records and materials developed therefrom (except Confidential Information stored in accordance with automated backup procedures in the ordinary course of business). Each party may disclose only the general nature, but not the specific terms, of any Contract without the prior consent of the other party; provided, Customer or Ovation may provide a copy of the Contract or otherwise disclose its terms in connection with any legal or regulatory requirement, audit, financing transaction or due diligence inquiry.\n\n\nCompelled Disclosures.\n These restrictions will not prevent either party from complying with any law, regulation, court order, demand by law enforcement or other legal requirement or investigation that purports to compel disclosure of any Service Data or other Confidential Information. The receiving party will promptly notify the disclosing party upon learning of any such legal requirement, and cooperate with the disclosing party in the exercise of its right to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information before any tribunal or governmental agency.\n\n\n6. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS.\n\n\nCustomer and Users.\n Customer and each User hereby grants Ovation a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide right and license: to access, copy, store, process, distribute, transmit, display and use their Customer Data to (i) provide the Service to Customer and all Users under Customer's Account and (ii) improve and enhance the Service and for other development, diagnostic and corrective purposes in connection with the Services and other Ovation products as services. . Customer and each applicable User hereby grants to Ovation all necessary permissions (including without limitation, any permission required under HIPAA) for Ovation to engage and work with trusted third parties to provide the Service. Except for the foregoing, no other right, license or option is granted, no other use is permitted and Customer or the applicable User (as the case may be) owns and retains all rights, title and interests (including without limitation, patent rights, copyright rights, trade secret rights and trademark rights) in and to the Customer Data.\n\n\nOvation.\n Except for the limited rights and licenses expressly granted hereunder, no other right, license or option is granted, no other use is permitted and (as between the parties) Ovation (and its licensors, where applicable) owns and retains all rights, title and interests (including without limitation, patent rights, copyright rights, trade secret rights and trademark rights) relating to the Ovation IP, including Service Data. Customer agrees that Ovation is free to use the Customer Data (pursuant to the section above), Feedback, and all generalized knowledge, expertise know-how and technologies related to or acquired in providing the Service, in any manner for all purposes (including developing new or improved products and services). Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Contract entered into pursuant to these Terms of Service is not a sale and does not convey to Customer any rights of ownership in or related to any Ovation IP, Service Data, or any intellectual property rights.\n\n\nRestrictions.\n Customer and Users shall not, directly or indirectly (a) use any of Ovation's Confidential Information to create any software, platform, service or documentation that is similar to any of the Ovation IP, (b) attempt to access any Platform component or to disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer or use any other means to discover any source code or underlying organization, structures, ideas or algorithms within the Platform or other Ovation IP (except and only to the extent these restrictions are expressly prohibited by applicable statutory law) or to circumvent any technological measure that controls access thereto, (c) encumber, sublicense, distribute, transfer, rent, lease, lend, access or use any Ovation IP in any time-share, service bureau or similar arrangement, (d) copy, adapt, combine, create derivative works of, translate, localize, port or otherwise modify any Ovation IP, (e) use or allow the transmission, transfer, export, re-export or other transfer of any product, technology or information it obtains or learns using the Service or Service Data (or any direct product thereof) in violation of any export control or other laws and regulations of the United States or any other relevant jurisdiction, (f) re-identify or attempt to re-identify any of the Service Data, or (f) permit any third party to do any of the foregoing.\n\n\nThird Party Software.\n The Platform may interface, inter-operate, link or be delivered with or include software or other technology ( In-Licensed Code ) that is licensed from and owned by third parties ( In-Licensors ), the use of which may be subject to additional or different terms set forth in the applicable open source or proprietary license ( In-License ). Customer and each User unconditionally agrees that the In-Licensors (a) make no representation or warranty concerning the In-Licensed Code or Ovation IP, (b) have no obligation or liability as a result of these Terms of Service and (c) are intended third party beneficiaries of these Terms of Service in respect of their respective In-Licensed Code. Upon specific written request received prior to the third anniversary of Acceptance, Ovation will make available the source code for In-Licensed Code, but only if doing so is required by the applicable In-License.\n\n\n\n\n\n7. LIMITED WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIMERS.\n\n\nCustomer and Users.\n Customer and each User warrants to Ovation that the access, transfer, collection, processing, distribution and use of Service Data as described in these Terms of Service complies with and will not violate applicable laws, regulations, rules or proprietary rights (including without limitation, professional and scientific standards, copyrights and rights regarding privacy, publicity and defamation).\n\n\nOvation.\n Ovation warrants to Customer that all Work will be provided in a professional manner and that it will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the Service available to Users at all times, subject to downtimes for scheduled maintenance, upgrades, repairs, security issues and emergency outages. Ovation will not be responsible for any delay, degradation or failure in the Service resulting from or attributable to (a) unusually high usage volumes, (b) failures in Customer Resources or any third party's services, networks or systems, (c) Customer's or any User's or third party's negligence, acts or omissions, (d) any force majeure or other cause beyond Ovation's reasonable control or (e) unauthorized access to the Service, breach of firewalls or other hacking.\n\n\nDisclaimers.\n EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SPECIFIED HEREIN, THE WORK, SERVICE, SERVICE DATA AND OTHER OVATION IP ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE\", WITHOUT REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. FOR CLARITY, OVATION AND ITS LICENSORS DO NOT WARRANT THAT: (A) ANY INFORMATION WILL BE TIMELY, ACCURATE, RELIABLE OR CORRECT; (B) THE WORK, SERVICE, SERVICE DATA OR OTHER OVATION IP WILL BE ERROR-FREE, UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE OR AVAILABLE AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME OR PLACE; (C) ANY DEFECTS OR ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED; OR (D) THE WORK, SERVICE, SERVICE DATA OR OTHER OVATION IP WILL MEET CUSTOMER'S OR ANY USER'S REQUIREMENTS OR THAT ANY OUTCOME CAN BE ACHIEVED.

INDEMNIFICATION.\n\n\nCustomer.\n Customer agrees to defend Ovation against any demand, suit, action or other claim by any third party (including any User under its Account) that is related to any use of the Service or Service Data provided by Customer or Users or any breach of Customer's or any User's obligations or warranties under these Terms of Service, and to indemnify Ovation for liabilities (as specified in settlements or judgment awards) that result from such claims.\n\n\nOvation.\n Ovation agrees to defend Customer and Users ( Customer Indemnitees ) against any demand, suit, action or other claim by any third party that the Service or any Deliverable misappropriates or infringes its intellectual property rights, and to indemnify Customer Indemnitees for liabilities (as specified in settlements or judgment awards) that result from such claims. If the Service or any Deliverable becomes or, in Ovation's opinion, is likely to become the subject of an injunction or other claim preventing its use as contemplated herein, Ovation may, at its option and expense (a) obtain the rights needed to continue providing the Service or using the Deliverable, or (b) replace or modify the Service or Deliverable without substantially compromising its principal functions. If (a) and (b) are not reasonably available, then Ovation may (c) upon written notice to Customer, terminate Customer's Account and stop providing the Service to Users, and refund to Customer any prepaid fees, pro-rated for the remainder of the prepaid period. The foregoing states the entire liability of Ovation, and Customer's and each User's exclusive remedy, with respect to any actual or alleged violation of intellectual property or proprietary rights by the Ovation IP or Work, any part thereof or their use or operation.\n\n\nExclusions.\n Ovation shall have no liability or obligation hereunder with respect to any claim attributable to (a) any use of the Ovation IP by Customer or any User not strictly in accord with these Terms of Service, or in an application or environment or on a platform or with devices for which it was not designed or contemplated or (b) alterations, combinations or enhancements of the Ovation IP not created by Ovation.\n\n\nConditions.\n The indemnifying party's obligations hereunder are conditioned on (a) the party seeking indemnification providing prompt written notice thereof and reasonable cooperation, information, and assistance in connection therewith and (b) the indemnifying party having sole control and authority to defend, settle or compromise such claim. The indemnified party may participate in the defense at its sole cost and expense. The indemnifying party will not enter into any settlement (other than for payment of money subject to its indemnity) that adversely affects the indemnified party's rights or interests without its prior written approval, not to be unreasonably withheld. The indemnifying party shall not be responsible for any settlement it does not approve in writing.\n\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n\nEXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS VOID, PROHIBITED OR UNENFORCEABLE BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR LIABILITIES TO THIRD PARTIES PURSUANT TO SECTION 8 (INDEMNIFICATION): IN NO EVENT SHALL OVATION (OR ITS LICENSORS), CUSTOMER OR ANY USER BE LIABLE CONCERNING THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE CONTRACT OR THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ANY CLAIM OR ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE), FOR ANY (A) LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OR INTERRUPTION OF USE, OR COST TO PROCURE SUBSTITUTE TECHNOLOGIES, GOODS OR SERVICES OR (B) INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, RELIANCE, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF BUSINESS, REVENUES, PROFITS OR GOODWILL; AND OVATION (AND ITS LICENSORS) SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER OR ANY USER FOR AGGREGATE DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF THE FEES IT, HE OR SHE (AS THE CASE MAY BE) PAID TO OVATION DURING THE PRIOR 12 MONTHS OR US$25.00, WHICHEVER IS GREATER; EVEN IF IT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THESE LIMITATIONS ARE INDEPENDENT FROM ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS OF SERVICE AND SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ANY REMEDY PROVIDED HEREIN.\n\n\nFOR USERS ONLY: SOME STATES AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n\n10. TERM AND TERMINATION.\n\n\nTerm.\n Customer's and its Users' ability to access the Platform and use the Service shall commence on the Contract effective date and will automatically extend on a month-to-month basis until terminated by Customer or Ovation. Customer or Ovation may terminate the Contract by giving at least 30 days prior written notice (email being sufficient) to the other. Users may discontinue their use of the Service at any time upon giving written notice to Customer.\n\n\nTermination for Cause.\n The Contract may be earlier terminated by either party if the other party breaches any material provision of these Terms of Service and fails to cure such breach within 30 days (10 days in the case of payment issues) after receiving written notice of such breach from the non-breaching party.\n\n\nEffects of Termination.\n Upon any expiration or termination of the Contract, all rights, obligations and licenses of the parties shall cease, except that the following shall survive: all obligations that accrued prior to the effective date of termination (including payment obligations); all remedies for any breach of these Terms of Service; and the provisions of Sections 4 (Payments), 5 (Confidentiality), 6 (Proprietary Rights), 7 (Limited Warranties and Disclaimers), 8 (Indemnification), 9 (Limitation of Liability), 11 (General Provisions) and this Section 10. Customer and Users shall not retain any Service Data or Ovation IP after any expiration or termination.

Upon Ovation's reasonable request, such return or destruction shall be confirmed in writing by the parties.\n\n\n11. GENERAL PROVISIONS.\n\n\nEntire Agreement.\n These Terms of Service (including then current Policies), together with the Contract and, if any, all Statements of Work, constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior negotiations, understandings or agreements (oral or written), among the parties regarding the subject matter hereof (and all past dealing or industry custom). Any additional, different or inconsistent terms on any related purchase order, even if signed by the parties hereafter, shall have no effect under these Terms of Service. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the terms set forth in these Terms of Service and the Contract, the terms in the Contract shall control as between Ovation and Customer. Except as expressly provided herein, no change, consent or waiver under these Terms of Service will be effective unless in writing and signed by the party against which enforcement is sought. The failure of any party to enforce its rights under these Terms of Service at any time, for any period will not be construed as a waiver of such rights, and the exercise of one right or remedy will not be deemed a waiver of any other right or remedy. If any provision of these Terms of Service is determined to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms of Service will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. These Terms of Service are in English only, which language shall be controlling in all respects. No version of these Terms of Service in another language shall be binding or of any effect.\n\n\nGoverning Law.\n The parties' rights and obligations under the Contract and these Terms of Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, USA, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions. In the event of any conflict between US and foreign laws, regulations and rules, US laws, regulations and rules shall govern. Neither the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods nor the implementation of the Computer Information Transactions Act in any jurisdiction shall apply to these Terms of Service.\n\n\nDispute Resolution.\n A printed version of these Terms of Service (and any Policy) and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to the Service, Contract or these Terms of Service (including any Policy) to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. Customer, Users and Ovation agree that any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to the Service, Contract or these Terms of Service (including any Policy) must be commenced within 1 year after the claim or cause of action arose. Otherwise, such claim or cause of action is permanently barred.\n\n\nExcept that either party may seek an injunction or other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction (as described below), all disputes between the parties arising out of or in relation to or in connection with the Service, Contract or these Terms of Service (including any Policy) shall be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the JAMS streamlined arbitration rules and procedures then in force, by one neutral arbitrator appointed in accordance with the rules. The arbitration shall take place in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. The proceedings shall be in English, all evidence shall be in English (or translated into English) and the governing law shall be as set forth herein. The arbitrator's decision shall be in writing and shall comply with all terms and conditions in the applicable version of these Terms of Service and the Contract. The decision and award rendered shall be final and binding on all parties. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Terms of Service and any award rendered pursuant hereto shall be governed by the UN Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n\nANY ARBITRATION UNDER THESE TERMS OF SERVICE WILL TAKE PLACE ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. CUSTOMER, USERS AND OVATION UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THE CONTRACT AND THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, EACH PARTY IS WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.\n\n\nUse of the Service is not authorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of the Terms of Service, including without limitation, this section.\n\n\nInternational Use.\n Ovation makes no representation or warranty that the Service is appropriate or legally available for use in locations outside the United States, and accessing and using the Service is prohibited from places where doing so would be illegal. Accessing or using the Service from other locations may be done at Customer's or applicable User's own initiative and Customer or such User shall be liable for compliance with all local laws. Customer each User hereby expressly consents to Ovation's processing of Service Data in accordance with these Terms of Service. Customer and each User understands and agrees that Service Data may be stored and processed in (or transferred from) the country where it was collected and the United States, and that United States laws regarding the collection, storage, processing and onward transfer of information may be less stringent than the laws where Customer is located.

If the Service or any Deliverable becomes or, in Ovation's opinion, is likely to become the subject of an injunction or other claim preventing its use as contemplated herein, Ovation may, at its option and expense (a) obtain the rights needed to continue providing the Service or using the Deliverable, or (b) replace or modify the Service or Deliverable without substantially compromising its principal functions. If (a) and (b) are not reasonably available, then Ovation may (c) upon written notice to Customer, terminate Customer's Account and stop providing the Service to Users, and refund to Customer any prepaid fees, pro-rated for the remainder of the prepaid period. The foregoing states the entire liability of Ovation, and Customer's and each User's exclusive remedy, with respect to any actual or alleged violation of intellectual property or proprietary rights by the Ovation IP or Work, any part thereof or their use or operation.  Exclusions.  Ovation shall have no liability or obligation hereunder with respect to any claim attributable to (a) any use of the Ovation IP by Customer or any User not strictly in accord with these Terms of Service, or in an application or environment or on a platform or with devices for which it was not designed or contemplated or (b) alterations, combinations or enhancements of the Ovation IP not created by Ovation.  Conditions.  The indemnifying party's obligations hereunder are conditioned on (a) the party seeking indemnification providing prompt written notice thereof and reasonable cooperation, information, and assistance in connection therewith and (b) the indemnifying party having sole control and authority to defend, settle or compromise such claim. The indemnified party may participate in the defense at its sole cost and expense. The indemnifying party will not enter into any settlement (other than for payment of money subject to its indemnity) that adversely affects the indemnified party's rights or interests without its prior written approval, not to be unreasonably withheld. The indemnifying party shall not be responsible for any settlement it does not approve in writing.",
