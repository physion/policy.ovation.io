The network components and supporting network infrastructure is contained within AWS and Rackspace infrastructure and managed by Rackspace and AWS. Ovation does not have physical access into the network components. The Ovation environment consists of Cisco firewalls, Apache web servers, Dropwizard Java application servers, Percona and Riak database servers, Logstash logging servers, Linux Ubuntu monitoring servers, Puppet access control server, OSSEC IDS services, Docker containers, Linux CentOS bastion host, and developer tools servers running on Linux Ubuntu.\n\n\nWithin the Ovation Platform, both on Rackspace and AWS, all data transmission is encrypted and all hard drives are encrypted so data at rest is also encrypted; this applies to all servers - those hosting Docker containers, databases, APIs, log servers, etc. Ovation assumes all data \nmay\n contain ePHI, even though our Risk Assessment does not indicate this is the case, and provides appropriate protections based on that assumption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, IPtables is used on each each server for logical segmentation. The IPtables are configured to restrict access to only justified ports and protocols. Ovation has implemented strict logical access controls so that only authorized personnel are given access to the internal management servers. The environment is configured so that data is transmitted from the load balancers to the application servers over an SSL encrypted session.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bastion host, Apache web server, Dropwizard application servers are externally facing and accessible via the Internet. The database servers, where the ePHI resides, are located on the internal Ovation network and can only be accessed directly over an SSH connection through the bastion host. The access to the internal database is restricted to a limited number of personnel and strictly controlled to only those personnel with a business justified reason. Remote access to the internal servers is not accessible except through the load balancers and bastion host.\n\n\nAll Platform Add-ons and operating systems are tested end-to-end for usability, security and impact prior to deployment to production.\n\n\nVersion Control\n\n\nPolicies were last updated July 5, 2017.",

Examples of precursors include:\n\n\n\n\nSuspicious network and host-based IDS events/attacks;\n\n\nAlerts as a result of detecting malicious code at the network and host levels;\n\n\nAlerts from file integrity checking software;\n\n\nAudit log alerts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk\n: The likelihood that a threat will exploit a vulnerability, and the impact of that event on the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of ePHI, other confidential or proprietary electronic information, and other system assets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Management Team\n: Individuals who are knowledgeable about the Organization\u2019s HIPAA Privacy, Security and HITECH policies, procedures, training program, computer system set up, and technical security controls, and who are responsible for the risk management process and procedures outlined below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Assessment\n: (Referred to as Risk Analysis in the HIPAA Security Rule); the process:\n\n\n\n\nIdentifies the risks to information system security and determines the probability of occurrence and the resulting impact for each threat/vulnerability pair identified given the security controls in place;\n\n\nPrioritizes risks; and\n\n\nResults in recommended possible actions/controls that could reduce or offset the determined risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Management\n: Within this policy, it refers to two major process components: risk assessment and risk mitigation. This differs from the HIPAA Security Rule, which defines it as a risk mitigation process only. The definition used in this policy is consistent with the one used in documents published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Mitigation\n: Referred to as Risk Management in the HIPAA Security Rule, and is a process that prioritizes, evaluates, and implements security controls that will reduce or offset the risks determined in the risk assessment process to satisfactory levels within an organization given its mission and available resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity Incident\n (or just Incident): A security incident is an occurrence that exercises a significant adverse effect on people, process, technology, or data.

Threats are commonly categorized as:\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental \u2013 external fires, HVAC failure/temperature inadequacy, water pipe burst, power failure/fluctuation, etc.\n\n\nHuman \u2013 hackers, data entry, workforce/ex-workforce members, impersonation, insertion of malicious code, theft, viruses, SPAM, vandalism, etc.\n\n\nNatural \u2013 fires, floods, electrical storms, tornados, etc.\n\n\nTechnological \u2013 server failure, software failure, ancillary equipment failure, etc. and environmental threats, such as power outages, hazardous material spills.\n\n\nOther \u2013 explosions, medical emergencies, misuse or resources, etc. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThreat Source\n: Any circumstance or event with the potential to cause harm (intentional or unintentional) to an IT system. Common threat sources can be natural, human or environmental which can impact the organization\u2019s ability to protect ePHI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThreat Action\n: The method by which an attack might be carried out (e.g., hacking, system intrusion, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnrestricted Area\n: Those areas of the building(s) where protected health information and/or sensitive organizational information is not stored or is not utilized or is not accessible there on a regular basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnsecured Protected Health Information\n: Protected health information (PHI) that is not rendered unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable to unauthorized individuals through the use of technology or methodology specified by the Secretary in the guidance issued under section 13402(h)(2) of Pub. L.111-5 on the HHS website.\n\n\n\n\nElectronic PHI has been encrypted as specified in the HIPAA Security rule by the use of an algorithmic process to transform data into a form in which there is a low probability of assigning meaning without the use of a confidential process or key and such confidential process or key that might enable decryption has not been breached. To avoid a breach of the confidential process or key, these decryption tools should be stored on a device or at a location separate from the data they are used to encrypt or decrypt. The following encryption processes meet this standard.\n\n\nValid encryption processes for data at rest (i.e. data that resides in databases, file systems and other structured storage systems) are consistent with NIST Special Publication 800-111, Guide to Storage Encryption Technologies for End User Devices.\n\n\nValid encryption processes for data in motion (i.e. data that is moving through a network, including wireless transmission) are those that comply, as appropriate, with NIST Special Publications 800-52, Guidelines for the Selection and Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) Implementations; 800-77, Guide to IPSec VPNs; or 800-113, Guide to SSL VPNs, and may include others which are Federal Information Processing Standards FIPS 140-2 validated.\n\n\nThe media on which the PHI is stored or recorded has been destroyed in the following ways:\n\n\nPaper, film, or other hard copy media have been shredded or destroyed such that the PHI cannot be read or otherwise cannot be reconstructed. Redaction is specifically excluded as a means of data destruction.\n\n\nElectronic media have been cleared, purged, or destroyed consistent with NIST Special Publications 800-88, Guidelines for Media Sanitization, such that the PHI cannot be retrieved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVendors\n: Persons from other organizations marketing or selling products or services, or providing services to Ovation. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVulnerability\n: A weakness or flaw in an information system that can be accidentally triggered or intentionally exploited by a threat and lead to a compromise in the integrity of that system, i.e., resulting in a security breach or violation of policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkstation\n: An electronic computing device, such as a laptop or desktop computer, or any other device that performs similar functions, used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI. Workstation devices may include, but are not limited to: laptop or desktop computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), tablet PCs, and other handheld devices. For the purposes of this policy, \u201cworkstation\u201d also includes the combination of hardware, operating system, application software, and network connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkforce\n: Means employees, volunteers, trainees, and other persons whose conduct, in the performance of work for a covered entity, is under the direct control of such entity, whether or not they are paid by the covered entity.",

Application Level : Controls and security associated with an Application.    Audit : Internal process of reviewing information system access and activity (e.g., log-ins, file accesses, and security incidents). An audit may be done as a periodic event, as a result of a patient complaint, or suspicion of employee wrongdoing.    Audit Controls : Technical mechanisms that track and record computer/system activities.    Audit Logs : Encrypted records of activity maintained by the system which provide: 1) date and time of activity; 2) origin of activity (app); 3) identification of user doing activity; and 4) data accessed as part of activity.    Access : Means the ability or the means necessary to read, write, modify, or communicate data or information or otherwise use any system resource.    Backup : The process of making an electronic copy of data stored in a computer system. This can either be complete, meaning all data and programs, or incremental, including just the data that changed from the previous backup.    Breach : Means the acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of protected health information (PHI) in a manner not permitted under the Privacy Rule which compromises the security or privacy of the PHI. For purpose of this definition, \u201ccompromises the security or privacy of the PHI\u201d means poses a significant risk of financial, reputational, or other harm to the individual. A use or disclosure of PHI that does not include the identifiers listed at \u00a7164.514(e)(2), limited data set, date of birth, and zip code does not compromise the security or privacy of the PHI. Breach excludes:   Any unintentional acquisition, access or use of PHI by a workforce member or person acting under the authority of a Covered Entity (CE) or Business Associate (BA) if such acquisition, access, or use was made in good faith and within the scope of authority and does not result in further use or disclosure in a manner not permitted under the Privacy Rule.  Any inadvertent disclosure by a person who is authorized to access PHI at a CE or BA to another person authorized to access PHI at the same CE or BA, or organized health care arrangement in which the CE participates, and the information received as a result of such disclosure is not further used or disclosed in a manner not permitted under the Privacy Rule.  A disclosure of PHI where a CE or BA has a good faith belief that an unauthorized person to whom the disclosure was made would not reasonably have been able to retain such information.

Indication : A sign that an Incident may have occurred or may be occurring at the present time. Examples of indications include:   The network intrusion detection sensor alerts when a known exploit occurs against an FTP server. Intrusion detection is generally reactive, looking only for footprints of known attacks. It is important to note that many IDS \u201chits\u201d are also false positives and are neither an event nor an incident;  The antivirus software alerts when it detects that a host is infected with a worm;  Users complain of slow access to hosts on the Internet;  The system administrator sees a filename with unusual characteristics;  Automated alerts of activity from log monitors like OSSEC;  An alert from OSSEC about file system integrity issues.     Intrusion Detection System (IDS) : A software tool used to automatically detect and notify in the event of possible unauthorized network and/or system access.     Law Enforcement Official : Any officer or employee of an agency or authority of the United States, a State, a territory, a political subdivision of a State or territory, or an Indian tribe, who is empowered by law to investigate or conduct an official inquiry into a potential violation of law; or prosecute or otherwise conduct a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding arising from an alleged violation of law.    Logging Service : A logging service for unifying system and application logs, encrypting them and storing them for access by authorized personnel.    Messaging : API-based services to deliver and receive SMS messages.

Protected Health Information (PHI) : Individually identifiable health information that is created by or received by the organization, including demographic information, that identifies an individual, or provides a reasonable basis to believe the information can be used to identify an individual, and relates to:   Past, present or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual.  The provision of health care to an individual.  The past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to an individual.     Role : The category or class of person or persons doing a type of job, defined by a set of similar or identical responsibilities.    Sanitization : Removal or the act of overwriting data to a point of preventing the recovery of the data on the device or media that is being sanitized. Sanitization is typically done before re-issuing a device or media, donating equipment that contained sensitive information or returning leased equipment to the lending company.    Trigger Event : Activities that may be indicative of a security breach that require further investigation (See Appendix).    Restricted Area : Those areas of the building(s) where protected health information and/or sensitive organizational information is stored, utilized, or accessible at any time.     Precursor : A sign that an Incident may occur in the future. Examples of precursors include:   Suspicious network and host-based IDS events/attacks;  Alerts as a result of detecting malicious code at the network and host levels;  Alerts from file integrity checking software;  Audit log alerts.     Risk : The likelihood that a threat will exploit a vulnerability, and the impact of that event on the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of ePHI, other confidential or proprietary electronic information, and other system assets.    Risk Management Team : Individuals who are knowledgeable about the Organization\u2019s HIPAA Privacy, Security and HITECH policies, procedures, training program, computer system set up, and technical security controls, and who are responsible for the risk management process and procedures outlined below.    Risk Assessment : (Referred to as Risk Analysis in the HIPAA Security Rule); the process:   Identifies the risks to information system security and determines the probability of occurrence and the resulting impact for each threat/vulnerability pair identified given the security controls in place;  Prioritizes risks; and  Results in recommended possible actions/controls that could reduce or offset the determined risk.     Risk Management : Within this policy, it refers to two major process components: risk assessment and risk mitigation. This differs from the HIPAA Security Rule, which defines it as a risk mitigation process only. The definition used in this policy is consistent with the one used in documents published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).    Risk Mitigation : Referred to as Risk Management in the HIPAA Security Rule, and is a process that prioritizes, evaluates, and implements security controls that will reduce or offset the risks determined in the risk assessment process to satisfactory levels within an organization given its mission and available resources.    Security Incident  (or just Incident): A security incident is an occurrence that exercises a significant adverse effect on people, process, technology, or data. Security incidents include, but are not limited to:    A system or network breach accomplished by an internal or external entity; this breach can be inadvertent or malicious;  Unauthorized disclosure;  Unauthorized change or destruction of ePHI (i.e. delete dictation, data alterations not following Ovation\u2019s procedures);  Denial of service not attributable to identifiable physical, environmental, human or technology causes;  Disaster or enacted threat to business continuity;  Information Security Incident: A violation or imminent threat of violation of information security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices. Examples of information security incidents may include, but are not limited to, the following:  Denial of Service: An attack that prevents or impairs the authorized use of networks, systems, or applications by exhausting resources;  Malicious Code: A virus, worm, Trojan horse, or other code-based malicious entity that infects a host;  Unauthorized Access/System Hijacking: A person gains logical or physical access without permission to a network, system, application, data, or other resource. Hijacking occurs when an attacker takes control of network devices or workstations;  Inappropriate Usage: A person violates acceptable computing use policies;  Other examples of observable information security incidents may include, but are not limited to:  Use of another person\u2019s individual password and/or account to login to a system;  Failure to protect passwords and/or access codes (e.g., posting passwords on equipment);  Installation of unauthorized software;  Terminated workforce member accessing applications, systems, or network.       Threat : The potential for a particular threat-source to successfully exercise a particular vulnerability. Threats are commonly categorized as:   Environmental \u2013 external fires, HVAC failure/temperature inadequacy, water pipe burst, power failure/fluctuation, etc.  Human \u2013 hackers, data entry, workforce/ex-workforce members, impersonation, insertion of malicious code, theft, viruses, SPAM, vandalism, etc.  Natural \u2013 fires, floods, electrical storms, tornados, etc.  Technological \u2013 server failure, software failure, ancillary equipment failure, etc. and environmental threats, such as power outages, hazardous material spills.  Other \u2013 explosions, medical emergencies, misuse or resources, etc.      Threat Source : Any circumstance or event with the potential to cause harm (intentional or unintentional) to an IT system. Common threat sources can be natural, human or environmental which can impact the organization\u2019s ability to protect ePHI.    Threat Action : The method by which an attack might be carried out (e.g., hacking, system intrusion, etc.).    Unrestricted Area : Those areas of the building(s) where protected health information and/or sensitive organizational information is not stored or is not utilized or is not accessible there on a regular basis.    Unsecured Protected Health Information : Protected health information (PHI) that is not rendered unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable to unauthorized individuals through the use of technology or methodology specified by the Secretary in the guidance issued under section 13402(h)(2) of Pub. L.111-5 on the HHS website.   Electronic PHI has been encrypted as specified in the HIPAA Security rule by the use of an algorithmic process to transform data into a form in which there is a low probability of assigning meaning without the use of a confidential process or key and such confidential process or key that might enable decryption has not been breached. To avoid a breach of the confidential process or key, these decryption tools should be stored on a device or at a location separate from the data they are used to encrypt or decrypt. The following encryption processes meet this standard.  Valid encryption processes for data at rest (i.e. data that resides in databases, file systems and other structured storage systems) are consistent with NIST Special Publication 800-111, Guide to Storage Encryption Technologies for End User Devices.  Valid encryption processes for data in motion (i.e. data that is moving through a network, including wireless transmission) are those that comply, as appropriate, with NIST Special Publications 800-52, Guidelines for the Selection and Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) Implementations; 800-77, Guide to IPSec VPNs; or 800-113, Guide to SSL VPNs, and may include others which are Federal Information Processing Standards FIPS 140-2 validated.  The media on which the PHI is stored or recorded has been destroyed in the following ways:  Paper, film, or other hard copy media have been shredded or destroyed such that the PHI cannot be read or otherwise cannot be reconstructed. Redaction is specifically excluded as a means of data destruction.  Electronic media have been cleared, purged, or destroyed consistent with NIST Special Publications 800-88, Guidelines for Media Sanitization, such that the PHI cannot be retrieved.     Vendors : Persons from other organizations marketing or selling products or services, or providing services to Ovation.     Vulnerability : A weakness or flaw in an information system that can be accidentally triggered or intentionally exploited by a threat and lead to a compromise in the integrity of that system, i.e., resulting in a security breach or violation of policy.    Workstation : An electronic computing device, such as a laptop or desktop computer, or any other device that performs similar functions, used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI. Workstation devices may include, but are not limited to: laptop or desktop computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), tablet PCs, and other handheld devices. For the purposes of this policy, \u201cworkstation\u201d also includes the combination of hardware, operating system, application software, and network connection.    Workforce : Means employees, volunteers, trainees, and other persons whose conduct, in the performance of work for a covered entity, is under the direct control of such entity, whether or not they are paid by the covered entity.",

All connections to Ovation are monitored. Access is limited to certain services, ports, and destinations. Exceptions to these rules, if created, are reviewed on an annual basis.     Ovation\u2019s auditing processes shall address access and activity at the following levels listed below. Auditing processes may address date and time of each log-on attempt, date and time of each log-off attempt, devices used, functions performed, etc.  User: User level audit trails generally monitor and log all commands directly initiated by the user, all identification and authentication attempts, and data and services accessed.  Application: Application level audit trails generally monitor and log all user activities, including data accessed and modified and specific actions.  System: System level audit trails generally monitor and log user activities, applications accessed, and other system defined specific actions. Ovation utilizes file system monitoring from OSSEC to assure the integrity of file system data.  Network: Network level audit trails generally monitor information on what is operating, penetrations, and vulnerabilities.    Ovation shall log all incoming and outgoing traffic to into and out of its environment. This includes all successful and failed attempts at data access and editing. Data associated with this data will include origin, destination, time, and other relevant details that are available to Ovation.  Ovation utilizes OSSEC to scan all systems for malicious and unauthorized software every 2 hours and at reboot of systems. Alerts from OSSEC are sent to Kibana, the centralized logging service that we use.  Ovation leverages process monitoring tools throughout its environment.  Ovation uses OSSEC to monitor the integrity of log files by utilizing OSSEC System Integrity Checking capabilities.

Breach notification will be carried out in compliance with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA)/Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) as well as any other federal or state notification law.\n\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has published breach notification rules for vendors of personal health records as required by ARRA/HITECH. The FTC rule applies to entities not covered by HIPAA, primarily vendors of personal health records. The rule is effective September 24, 2009 with full compliance required by February 22, 2010.\n\n\nThe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. Title XIII of ARRA is the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH). HITECH significantly impacts the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules.  While HIPAA did not require notification when patient protected health information (PHI) was inappropriately disclosed, covered entities and business associates may have chosen to include notification as part of the mitigation process. HITECH does require notification of certain breaches of unsecured PHI to the following: individuals, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the media. The effective implementation for this provision is September 23, 2009 (pending publication HHS regulations).\n\n\nIn the case of a breach, Ovation shall notify all affected Customers. It is the responsibility of the Customers to notify affected individuals.\n\n\nApplicable Standards from the HITRUST Common Security Framework\n\n\n\n\n11.a Reporting Information Security Events\n\n\n11.c Responsibilities and Procedures\n\n\n\n\nApplicable Standards from the HIPAA Security Rule\n\n\n\n\nSecurity Incident Procedures - 164.308(a)(6)(i)\n\n\nHITECH Notification in the Case of Breach - 13402(a) and 13402(b)\n\n\nHITECH Timeliness of Notification - 13402(d)(1)\n\n\nHITECH Content of Notification - 13402(f)(1)\n\n\n\n\nOvation Breach Policy\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery of Breach: A breach of ePHI shall be treated as \u201cdiscovered\u201d as of the first day on which such breach is known to the organization, or, by exercising reasonable diligence would have been known to Ovation (includes breaches by the organization\u2019s Customers, Partners, or subcontractors). Ovation shall be deemed to have knowledge of a breach if such breach is known or by exercising reasonable diligence would have been known, to any person, other than the person committing the breach, who is a workforce member or Partner of the organization. Following the discovery of a potential breach, the organization shall begin an investigation (see organizational policies for security incident response and/or risk management incident response) immediately, conduct a risk assessment, and based on the results of the risk assessment, begin the process to notify each Customer affected by the breach. Ovation shall also begin the process of determining what external notifications are required or should be made (e.g., Secretary of Department of Health & Human Services (HHS), media outlets, law enforcement officials, etc.)\n\n\nBreach Investigation: The Ovation Security Officer shall name an individual to act as the investigator of the breach (e.g., privacy officer, security officer, risk manager, etc.).  The investigator shall be responsible for the management of the breach investigation, completion of a risk assessment, and coordinating with others in the organization as appropriate (e.g., administration, security incident response team, human resources, risk management, public relations, legal counsel, etc.) The investigator shall be the key facilitator for all breach notification processes to the appropriate entities (e.g., HHS, media, law enforcement officials, etc.).  All documentation related to the breach investigation, including the risk assessment, shall be retained for a minimum of six years. \n\n\nRisk Assessment: For an acquisition, access, use or disclosure of ePHI to constitute a breach, it must constitute a violation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. A use or disclosure of ePHI that is incident to an otherwise permissible use or disclosure that occurs despite reasonable safeguards and proper minimum necessary procedures would not be a violation of the Privacy Rule and would not qualify as a potential breach. To determine if an impermissible use or disclosure of ePHI constitutes a breach and requires further notification, the organization will need to perform a risk assessment to determine if there is significant risk of harm to the individual as a result of the impermissible use or disclosure. The organization shall document the risk assessment as part of the investigation in the incident report form noting the outcome of the risk assessment process. The organization has the burden of proof for demonstrating that all notifications to appropriate Customers or that the use or disclosure did not constitute a breach. Based on the outcome of the risk assessment, the organization will determine the need to move forward with breach notification. The risk assessment and the supporting documentation shall be fact specific and address:\n\n\nConsideration of who impermissibly used or to whom the information was impermissibly disclosed;\n\n\nThe type and amount of ePHI involved;\n\n\nThe cause of the breach, and the entity responsible for the breach, either Customer, Ovation, or Partner.\n\n\nThe potential for significant risk of financial, reputational, or other harm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeliness of Notification: Upon discovery of a breach, notice shall be made to the affected Ovation Customers no later than 24 hours after the discovery of the breach.

Breach notification will be carried out in compliance with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA)/Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) as well as any other federal or state notification law.  The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has published breach notification rules for vendors of personal health records as required by ARRA/HITECH. The FTC rule applies to entities not covered by HIPAA, primarily vendors of personal health records. The rule is effective September 24, 2009 with full compliance required by February 22, 2010.  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. Title XIII of ARRA is the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH). HITECH significantly impacts the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules.  While HIPAA did not require notification when patient protected health information (PHI) was inappropriately disclosed, covered entities and business associates may have chosen to include notification as part of the mitigation process. HITECH does require notification of certain breaches of unsecured PHI to the following: individuals, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the media. The effective implementation for this provision is September 23, 2009 (pending publication HHS regulations).  In the case of a breach, Ovation shall notify all affected Customers. It is the responsibility of the Customers to notify affected individuals.",

Ovation shall be deemed to have knowledge of a breach if such breach is known or by exercising reasonable diligence would have been known, to any person, other than the person committing the breach, who is a workforce member or Partner of the organization. Following the discovery of a potential breach, the organization shall begin an investigation (see organizational policies for security incident response and/or risk management incident response) immediately, conduct a risk assessment, and based on the results of the risk assessment, begin the process to notify each Customer affected by the breach. Ovation shall also begin the process of determining what external notifications are required or should be made (e.g., Secretary of Department of Health & Human Services (HHS), media outlets, law enforcement officials, etc.)  Breach Investigation: The Ovation Security Officer shall name an individual to act as the investigator of the breach (e.g., privacy officer, security officer, risk manager, etc.).  The investigator shall be responsible for the management of the breach investigation, completion of a risk assessment, and coordinating with others in the organization as appropriate (e.g., administration, security incident response team, human resources, risk management, public relations, legal counsel, etc.) The investigator shall be the key facilitator for all breach notification processes to the appropriate entities (e.g., HHS, media, law enforcement officials, etc.).  All documentation related to the breach investigation, including the risk assessment, shall be retained for a minimum of six years.   Risk Assessment: For an acquisition, access, use or disclosure of ePHI to constitute a breach, it must constitute a violation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. A use or disclosure of ePHI that is incident to an otherwise permissible use or disclosure that occurs despite reasonable safeguards and proper minimum necessary procedures would not be a violation of the Privacy Rule and would not qualify as a potential breach. To determine if an impermissible use or disclosure of ePHI constitutes a breach and requires further notification, the organization will need to perform a risk assessment to determine if there is significant risk of harm to the individual as a result of the impermissible use or disclosure. The organization shall document the risk assessment as part of the investigation in the incident report form noting the outcome of the risk assessment process. The organization has the burden of proof for demonstrating that all notifications to appropriate Customers or that the use or disclosure did not constitute a breach. Based on the outcome of the risk assessment, the organization will determine the need to move forward with breach notification. The risk assessment and the supporting documentation shall be fact specific and address:  Consideration of who impermissibly used or to whom the information was impermissibly disclosed;  The type and amount of ePHI involved;  The cause of the breach, and the entity responsible for the breach, either Customer, Ovation, or Partner.  The potential for significant risk of financial, reputational, or other harm.    Timeliness of Notification: Upon discovery of a breach, notice shall be made to the affected Ovation Customers no later than 24 hours after the discovery of the breach. It is the responsibility of the organization to demonstrate that all notifications were made as required, including evidence demonstrating the necessity of delay.  Delay of Notification Authorized for Law Enforcement Purposes:  If a law enforcement official states to the organization that a notification, notice, or posting would impede a criminal investigation or cause damage to national security, the organization shall:  If the statement is in writing and specifies the time for which a delay is required, delay such notification, notice, or posting of the time period specified by the official; or  If the statement is made orally, document the statement, including the identify of the official making the statement, and delay the notification, notice, or posting temporarily and no longer than 30 days from the date of the oral statement, unless a written statement as described above is submitted during that time.    Content of the Notice: The notice shall be written in plain language and must contain the following information:  A brief description of what happened, including the date of the breach and the date of the discovery of the breach, if known;  A description of the types of unsecured protected health information that were involved in the breach (such as whether full name, Social Security number, date of birth, home address, account number, diagnosis, disability code or other types of information were involved), if known;  Any steps the Customer should take to protect Customer data from potential harm resulting from the breach.  A brief description of what Ovation is doing to investigate the breach, to mitigate harm to individuals and Customers, and to protect against further breaches.  Contact procedures for individuals to ask questions or learn additional information, which may include a toll-free telephone number, an e-mail address, a web site, or postal address.    Methods of Notification: Ovation Customers will be notified via email and phone within the timeframe for reporting breaches, as outlined above.  Maintenance of Breach Information/Log: As described above and in addition to the reports created for each incident, Ovation shall maintain a process to record or log all breaches of unsecured ePHI regardless of the number of records and Customers affected. The following information should be collected/logged for each breach:   A description of what happened, including the date of the breach, the date of the discovery of the breach, and the number of records and Customers affected, if known.

A description of the action taken with regard to notification of patients regarding the breach.  Resolution steps taken to mitigate the breach and prevent future occurrences.    Workforce Training: Ovation shall train all members of its workforce on the policies and procedures with respect to ePHI as necessary and appropriate for the members to carry out their job responsibilities. Workforce members shall also be trained as to how to identify and report breaches within the organization.  Complaints: Ovation must provide a process for individuals to make complaints concerning the organization\u2019s patient privacy policies and procedures or its compliance with such policies and procedures.  Sanctions: The organization shall have in place and apply appropriate sanctions against members of its workforce, Customers, and Partners who fail to comply with privacy policies and procedures.  Retaliation/Waiver: Ovation may not intimidate, threaten, coerce, discriminate against, or take other retaliatory action against any individual for the exercise by the individual of any privacy right.

Members of the team include personnel who are also responsible for the daily operations and maintenance of Ovation. The team leader is the Chief Architect and directs the Dev Ops Team.\n\n\nThe \nWeb Services Team\n is responsible for assuring all application servers, and web services are working. It is also responsible for testing redeployments and assessing damage to the environment. The team leader is the Chief Architect and directs the Web Services Team.\n\n\n\n\nTesting and Maintenance\n\n\nThe CTO and Chief Architect shall establish criteria for validation/testing of a Contingency Plan, an annual test schedule, and ensure implementation of the test. This process will also serve as training for personnel involved in the plan\u2019s execution. At a minimum the Contingency Plan shall be tested annually (within 365 days). The types of validation/testing exercises include tabletop and technical testing. Contingency Plans for all application systems must be tested at a minimum using the tabletop testing process. However, if the application system Contingency Plan is included in the technical testing of their respective support systems that technical test will satisfy the annual requirement.\n\n\nTabletop Testing\n\n\nTabletop Testing is conducted in accordance with the the CMS Risk Management Handbook, Volume 2 (http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/CMS-Information-Technology/InformationSecurity/Downloads/RMH_VII_4-5_Contingency_Plan_Exercise.pdf). The primary objective of the tabletop test is to ensure designated personnel are knowledgeable and capable of performing the notification/activation requirements and procedures as outlined in the CP, in a timely manner. The exercises include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n\n\nTesting to validate the ability to respond to a crisis in a coordinated, timely, and effective manner, by simulating the occurrence of a specific crisis.\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Testing\n\n\nThe primary objective of the technical test is to ensure the communication processes and data storage and recovery processes can function at an alternate site to perform the functions and capabilities of the system within the designated requirements. Technical testing shall include, but is not limited to:\n\n\n\n\nProcess from backup system at the alternate site;\n\n\nRestore system using backups; and\n\n\nSwitch compute and storage resources to alternate processing site.\n\n\n\n\n1. Notification and Activation Phase\n\n\nThis phase addresses the initial actions taken to detect and assess damage inflicted by a disruption to Ovation. Based on the assessment of the Event, sometimes according to the Ovation Incident Response Policy, the Contingency Plan may be activated by either the CTO or Chief Architect.\n\n\nThe notification sequence is listed below:\n\n\n\n\nThe first responder is to notify the CTO. All known information must be relayed to the CTO.\n\n\nThe Chief Architect is to contact the Web Services Team and inform them of the event. The CTO is to to begin assessment procedures.\n\n\nThe CTO is to notify team members and direct them to complete the assessment procedures outlined below to determine the extent of damage and estimated recovery time. If damage assessment cannot be performed locally because of unsafe conditions, the CTO is to follow the steps below.\n\n\nDamage Assessment Procedures:\n\n\nThe CTO and Chief Architect are to logically assess damage, gain insight into whether the infrastructure is salvageable, and begin to formulate a plan for recovery.\n\n\nAlternate Assessment Procedures:\n\n\nUpon notification from the CTO, the Chief Architect is to follow the procedures for damage assessment with combined DevOps and Web Services Teams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ovation Contingency Plan is to be activated if one or more of the following criteria are met:\n\n\n\n\nOvation will be unavailable for more than 48 hours.\n\n\nHosting facility is damaged and will be unavailable for more than 24 hours.\n\n\nOther criteria, as appropriate and as defined by Ovation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the plan is to be activated, the CTO is to notify and inform team members of the details of the event and if relocation is required.\n\n\n\n\nUpon notification from the CTO, group leaders and managers are to notify their respective teams. Team members are to be informed of all applicable information and prepared to respond and relocate if necessary.\n\n\nThe CTO is to notify the hosting facility partners that a contingency event has been declared and to ship the necessary materials (as determined by damage assessment) to the alternate site.\n\n\nThe CTO is to notify remaining personnel and executive leadership on the general status of the incident.\n\n\nNotification can be message, email, or phone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Recovery Phase\n\n\nThis section provides procedures for recovering the application at an alternate site, whereas other efforts are directed to repair damage to the original system and capabilities.\n\n\nThe following procedures are for recovering the Ovation infrastructure at the alternate site. Procedures are outlined per team required. Each procedure should be executed in the sequence it is presented to maintain efficient operations.\n\n\nRecovery Goal: The goal is to rebuild Ovation infrastructure to a production state.\n\n\nThe tasks outlines below are not sequential and some can be run in parallel.\n\n\n\n\nContact Partners and Customers affected - Web Services\n\n\nAssess damage to the environment - Web Services\n\n\nBegin replication of new environment using automated and tested scrips, currently Salt and/or AWS Elastic Beanstalk environments. A this point it is determined whether to recover in AWS or in Rackspace. - Dev Ops\n\n\nTest new environment using pre-written tests - Web Services\n\n\nTest logging, security, and alerting functionality - Dev Ops\n\n\nAssure systems are appropriately patched and up to date. - Dev Ops\n\n\nDeploy environment to production - Web Services\n\n\nUpdate DNS to new environment. - Dev Ops\n\n\n\n\n3. Reconstitution Phase\n\n\nThis section discusses activities necessary for restoring Ovation operations at the original or new site. The goal is to restore full operations within 24 hours of a disaster or outage. When the hosted data center at the original or new site has been restored, Ovation operations at the alternate site may be transitioned back. The goal is to provide a seamless transition of operations from the alternate site to the computer center.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal or New Site Restoration\n\n\n\n\nBegin replication of new environment using automated and tested scrips, currently Salt and/or AWS Elastic Beanstalk environments. - Dev Ops\n\n\nTest new environment using pre-written tests. - Web Services\n\n\nTest logging, security, and alerting functionality. - Dev Ops\n\n\nDeploy environment to production - Web Services\n\n\nAssure systems are appropriately patched and up to date. - Dev Ops\n\n\nUpdate DNS to new environment. - Dev Ops\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlan Deactivation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the Ovation environment is moved back to the original site from the alternative site, all hardware used at the alternate site should be handled and disposed of according to the Ovation Media Disposal Policy.",

The Chief Architect is to contact the Web Services Team and inform them of the event. The CTO is to to begin assessment procedures.  The CTO is to notify team members and direct them to complete the assessment procedures outlined below to determine the extent of damage and estimated recovery time. If damage assessment cannot be performed locally because of unsafe conditions, the CTO is to follow the steps below.  Damage Assessment Procedures:  The CTO and Chief Architect are to logically assess damage, gain insight into whether the infrastructure is salvageable, and begin to formulate a plan for recovery.  Alternate Assessment Procedures:  Upon notification from the CTO, the Chief Architect is to follow the procedures for damage assessment with combined DevOps and Web Services Teams.     The Ovation Contingency Plan is to be activated if one or more of the following criteria are met:   Ovation will be unavailable for more than 48 hours.  Hosting facility is damaged and will be unavailable for more than 24 hours.  Other criteria, as appropriate and as defined by Ovation.     If the plan is to be activated, the CTO is to notify and inform team members of the details of the event and if relocation is required.   Upon notification from the CTO, group leaders and managers are to notify their respective teams. Team members are to be informed of all applicable information and prepared to respond and relocate if necessary.  The CTO is to notify the hosting facility partners that a contingency event has been declared and to ship the necessary materials (as determined by damage assessment) to the alternate site.  The CTO is to notify remaining personnel and executive leadership on the general status of the incident.  Notification can be message, email, or phone.",

Any workforce member that violates this policy will be subject to disciplinary action based on the severity of the violation according to Ovation\u2019s policies, which is outlined in the Ovation Policy Management Policy.\n\n\nThe implementation, execution, and maintenance of the information security risk analysis and risk management process is the responsibility of Ovation\u2019s Security Officer (or other designated employee), and the identified Risk Management Team.\n\n\nAll risk management efforts, including decisions made on what controls to put in place as well as those to not put into place, are documented and the documentation is maintained for six years.\n\n\n\n\nRisk Management Procedures\n\n\nRisk Assessment\n: The intent of completing a risk assessment is to determine potential threats and vulnerabilities and the likelihood and impact should they occur. The output of this process helps to identify appropriate controls for reducing or eliminating risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1. System Characterization\n\n\n\n\nThe first step in assessing risk is to define the scope of the effort. To do this, identify where ePHI is received, maintained, processed, or transmitted. Using information-gathering techniques, the Ovation Platform boundaries are identified.\n\n\nOutput \u2013 Characterization of the Ovation Platform system assessed, a good picture of the Platform environment, and delineation of Platform boundaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2. Threat Identification\n\n\n\n\nPotential threats (the potential for threat-sources to successfully exercise a particular vulnerability) are identified and documented. All potential threat-sources through the review of historical incidents and data from intelligence agencies, the government, etc., to help generate a list of potential threats.\n\n\nOutput \u2013 A threat list containing a list of threat-sources that could exploit Platform vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. Vulnerability Identification\n\n\n\n\nDevelop a list of technical and non-technical Platform vulnerabilities that could be exploited or triggered by potential threat-sources. Vulnerabilities can range from incomplete or conflicting policies that govern an organization\u2019s computer usage to insufficient safeguards to protect facilities that house computer equipment to any number of software, hardware, or other deficiencies that comprise an organization\u2019s computer network.\n\n\nOutput \u2013 A list of the Platform vulnerabilities (observations) that could be exercised by potential threat-sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4. Control Analysis\n\n\n\n\nDocument and assess the effectiveness of technical and non-technical controls that have been or will be implemented by Ovation to minimize or eliminate the likelihood / probability of a threat-source exploiting a Platform vulnerability.\n\n\nOutput \u2013 List of current or planned controls (policies, procedures, training, technical mechanisms, insurance, etc.) used for the Platform to mitigate the likelihood of a vulnerability being exercised and reduce the impact of such an adverse event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5. Likelihood Determination\n\n\n\n\nDetermine the overall likelihood rating that indicates the probability that a vulnerability could be exploited by a threat-source given the existing or planned security controls.\n\n\nOutput \u2013 Likelihood rating of low (.1), medium (.5), or high (1). Refer to the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 6. Impact Analysis\n\n\n\n\nDetermine the level of adverse impact that would result from a threat successfully exploiting a vulnerability. Factors of the data and systems to consider should include the importance to Ovation's mission; sensitivity and criticality (value or importance); costs associated; loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and data.\n\n\nOutput \u2013 Magnitude of impact rating of low (10), medium (50), or high (100). Refer to the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 7. Risk Determination\n\n\n\n\nEstablish a risk level. By multiplying the ratings from the likelihood determination and impact analysis, a risk level is determined. This represents the degree or level of risk to which an IT system, facility, or procedure might be exposed if a given vulnerability were exercised. The risk rating also presents actions that senior management must take for each risk level.\n\n\nOutput \u2013 Risk level of low (1-10), medium (>10-50) or high (>50-100). Refer to the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 8. Control Recommendations\n\n\n\n\nIdentify controls that could reduce or eliminate the identified risks, as appropriate to the organization\u2019s operations to an acceptable level. Factors to consider when developing controls may include effectiveness of recommended options (i.e., system compatibility), legislation and regulation, organizational policy, operational impact, and safety and reliability. Control recommendations provide input to the risk mitigation process, during which the recommended procedural and technical security controls are evaluated, prioritized, and implemented.\n\n\nOutput \u2013 Recommendation of control(s) and alternative solutions to mitigate risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 9. Results Documentation\n\n\n\n\nResults of the risk assessment are documented in an official report, spreadsheet, or briefing and provided to senior management to make decisions on policy, procedure, budget, and Platform operational and management changes.\n\n\nOutput \u2013 A risk assessment report that describes the threats and vulnerabilities, measures the risk, and provides recommendations for control implementation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Mitigation\n: Risk mitigation involves prioritizing, evaluating, and implementing the appropriate risk-reducing controls recommended from the Risk Assessment process to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Ovation Platform ePHI. Determination of appropriate controls to reduce risk is dependent upon the risk tolerance of the organization consistent with its goals and mission. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1. Prioritize Actions\n\n\n\n\nUsing results from Step 7 of the Risk Assessment, sort the threat and vulnerability pairs according to their risk-levels in descending order. This establishes a prioritized list of actions needing to be taken, with the pairs at the top of the list getting/requiring the most immediate attention and top priority in allocating resources\n\n\nOutput \u2013 Actions ranked from high to low\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2. Evaluate Recommended Control Options\n\n\n\n\nAlthough possible controls for each threat and vulnerability pair are arrived at in Step 8 of the Risk Assessment, review the recommended control(s) and alternative solutions for reasonableness and appropriateness. The feasibility (e.g., compatibility, user acceptance, etc.) and effectiveness (e.g., degree of protection and level of risk mitigation) of the recommended controls should be analyzed. In the end, select a \u201cmost appropriate\u201d control option for each threat and vulnerability pair.\n\n\nOutput \u2013 list of feasible controls\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. Conduct Cost-Benefit Analysis\n\n\n\n\nDetermine the extent to which a control is cost-effective. Compare the benefit (e.g., risk reduction) of applying a control with its subsequent cost of application. Controls that are not cost-effective are also identified during this step. Analyzing each control or set of controls in this manner, and prioritizing across all controls being considered, can greatly aid in the decision-making process.\n\n\nOutput \u2013 Documented cost-benefit analysis of either implementing or not implementing each specific control\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4. Select Control(s)\n\n\n\n\nTaking into account the information and results from previous steps, Ovation\u2019s mission, and other important criteria, the Risk Management Team determines the best control(s) for reducing risks to the information systems and to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI. These controls may consist of a mix of administrative, physical, and/or technical safeguards.\n\n\nOutput \u2013 Selected control(s)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5. Assign Responsibility \n\n\n\n\nIdentify the workforce members with the skills necessary to implement each of the specific controls outlined in the previous step, and assign their responsibilities. Also identify the equipment, training and other resources needed for the successful implementation of controls. Resources may include time, money, equipment, etc.\n\n\nOutput \u2013 List of resources, responsible persons and their assignments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 6. Develop Safeguard Implementation Plan\n\n\n\n\nDevelop an overall implementation or action plan and individual project plans needed to implement the safeguards and controls identified. The Implementation Plan should contain the following information:\n\n\nEach risk or vulnerability/threat pair and risk level;\n\n\nPrioritized actions;\n\n\nThe recommended feasible control(s) for each identified risk;\n\n\nRequired resources for implementation of selected controls;\n\n\nTeam member responsible for implementation of each control;\n\n\nStart date for implementation\n\n\nTarget date for completion of implementation;\n\n\nMaintenance requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe overall implementation plan provides a broad overview of the safeguard implementation, identifying important milestones and timeframes, resource requirements (staff and other individuals\u2019 time, budget, etc.), interrelationships between projects, and any other relevant information. Regular status reporting of the plan, along with key metrics and success indicators should be reported to Ovation Senior Management.\n\n\nIndividual project plans for safeguard implementation may be developed and contain detailed steps that resources assigned carry out to meet implementation timeframes and expectations. Additionally, consider including items in individual project plans such as a project scope, a list deliverables, key assumptions, objectives, task completion dates and project requirements.\n\n\nOutput \u2013 Safeguard Implementation Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 7. Implement Selected Controls\n\n\n\n\nAs controls are implemented, monitor the affected system(s) to verify that the implemented controls continue to meet expectations. Elimination of all risk is not practical. Depending on individual situations, implemented controls may lower a risk level but not completely eliminate the risk.\n\n\nContinually and consistently communicate expectations to all Risk Management Team members, as well as senior management and other key people throughout the risk mitigation process. Identify when new risks are identified and when controls lower or offset risk rather than eliminate it.\n\n\nAdditional monitoring is especially crucial during times of major environmental changes, organizational or process changes, or major facilities changes.\n\n\nIf risk reduction expectations are not met, then repeat all or a part of the risk management process so that additional controls needed to lower risk to an acceptable level can be identified.\n\n\nOutput \u2013 Residual Risk documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Management Schedule\n: The two principle components of the risk management process - risk assessment and risk mitigation - will be carried out according to the following schedule to ensure the continued adequacy and continuous improvement of Ovation\u2019s information security program:\n\n\n\n\nScheduled Basis \u2013 an overall risk assessment of Ovation\u2019s information system infrastructure will be conducted annually. The assessment process should be completed in a timely fashion so that risk mitigation strategies can be determined and included in the corporate budgeting process.\n\n\nThroughout a System\u2019s Development Life Cycle \u2013 from the time that a need for a new, untested information system configuration and/or application is identified through the time it is disposed of, ongoing assessments of the potential threats to a system and its vulnerabilities should be undertaken as a part of the maintenance of the system.\n\n\nAs Needed \u2013 the Security Officer (or other designated employee) or Risk Management Team may call for a full or partial risk assessment in response to changes in business strategies, information technology, information sensitivity, threats, legal liabilities, or other significant factors that affect Ovation\u2019s Platform.\n\n\n\n\nProcess Documentation\n\n\nMaintain documentation of all risk assessment, risk management, and risk mitigation efforts for a minimum of six years.",

Ovation performs periodic technical and non-technical assessments of the security rule requirements as well as in response to environmental or operational changes affecting the security of ePHI.    Ovation implements security measures sufficient to reduce risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level to:  Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all ePHI Ovation receives, maintains, processes, and/or transmits for its Customers;  Protect against any reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of Customer ePHI;  Protect against any reasonably anticipated uses or disclosures of Customer ePHI that are not permitted or required; and  Ensure compliance by all workforce members.    Any risk remaining (residual) after other risk controls have been applied, requires sign off by the senior management and Ovation\u2019s Security Officer.  All Ovation workforce members are expected to fully cooperate with all persons charged with doing risk management work, including contractors and audit personnel. Any workforce member that violates this policy will be subject to disciplinary action based on the severity of the violation according to Ovation\u2019s policies, which is outlined in the Ovation Policy Management Policy.  The implementation, execution, and maintenance of the information security risk analysis and risk management process is the responsibility of Ovation\u2019s Security Officer (or other designated employee), and the identified Risk Management Team.  All risk management efforts, including decisions made on what controls to put in place as well as those to not put into place, are documented and the documentation is maintained for six years.",

            "text": "Risk Assessment : The intent of completing a risk assessment is to determine potential threats and vulnerabilities and the likelihood and impact should they occur. The output of this process helps to identify appropriate controls for reducing or eliminating risk.    Step 1. System Characterization   The first step in assessing risk is to define the scope of the effort. To do this, identify where ePHI is received, maintained, processed, or transmitted. Using information-gathering techniques, the Ovation Platform boundaries are identified.  Output \u2013 Characterization of the Ovation Platform system assessed, a good picture of the Platform environment, and delineation of Platform boundaries.     Step 2. Threat Identification   Potential threats (the potential for threat-sources to successfully exercise a particular vulnerability) are identified and documented. All potential threat-sources through the review of historical incidents and data from intelligence agencies, the government, etc., to help generate a list of potential threats.  Output \u2013 A threat list containing a list of threat-sources that could exploit Platform vulnerabilities.     Step 3. Vulnerability Identification   Develop a list of technical and non-technical Platform vulnerabilities that could be exploited or triggered by potential threat-sources. Vulnerabilities can range from incomplete or conflicting policies that govern an organization\u2019s computer usage to insufficient safeguards to protect facilities that house computer equipment to any number of software, hardware, or other deficiencies that comprise an organization\u2019s computer network.  Output \u2013 A list of the Platform vulnerabilities (observations) that could be exercised by potential threat-sources.     Step 4. Control Analysis   Document and assess the effectiveness of technical and non-technical controls that have been or will be implemented by Ovation to minimize or eliminate the likelihood / probability of a threat-source exploiting a Platform vulnerability.  Output \u2013 List of current or planned controls (policies, procedures, training, technical mechanisms, insurance, etc.) used for the Platform to mitigate the likelihood of a vulnerability being exercised and reduce the impact of such an adverse event.     Step 5. Likelihood Determination   Determine the overall likelihood rating that indicates the probability that a vulnerability could be exploited by a threat-source given the existing or planned security controls.  Output \u2013 Likelihood rating of low (.1), medium (.5), or high (1). Refer to the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high.     Step 6. Impact Analysis   Determine the level of adverse impact that would result from a threat successfully exploiting a vulnerability. Factors of the data and systems to consider should include the importance to Ovation's mission; sensitivity and criticality (value or importance); costs associated; loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and data.  Output \u2013 Magnitude of impact rating of low (10), medium (50), or high (100). Refer to the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high.     Step 7. Risk Determination   Establish a risk level. By multiplying the ratings from the likelihood determination and impact analysis, a risk level is determined. This represents the degree or level of risk to which an IT system, facility, or procedure might be exposed if a given vulnerability were exercised. The risk rating also presents actions that senior management must take for each risk level.  Output \u2013 Risk level of low (1-10), medium (>10-50) or high (>50-100). Refer to the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high.     Step 8. Control Recommendations   Identify controls that could reduce or eliminate the identified risks, as appropriate to the organization\u2019s operations to an acceptable level. Factors to consider when developing controls may include effectiveness of recommended options (i.e., system compatibility), legislation and regulation, organizational policy, operational impact, and safety and reliability. Control recommendations provide input to the risk mitigation process, during which the recommended procedural and technical security controls are evaluated, prioritized, and implemented.  Output \u2013 Recommendation of control(s) and alternative solutions to mitigate risk.     Step 9. Results Documentation   Results of the risk assessment are documented in an official report, spreadsheet, or briefing and provided to senior management to make decisions on policy, procedure, budget, and Platform operational and management changes.  Output \u2013 A risk assessment report that describes the threats and vulnerabilities, measures the risk, and provides recommendations for control implementation.     Risk Mitigation : Risk mitigation involves prioritizing, evaluating, and implementing the appropriate risk-reducing controls recommended from the Risk Assessment process to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Ovation Platform ePHI. Determination of appropriate controls to reduce risk is dependent upon the risk tolerance of the organization consistent with its goals and mission.     Step 1. Prioritize Actions   Using results from Step 7 of the Risk Assessment, sort the threat and vulnerability pairs according to their risk-levels in descending order. This establishes a prioritized list of actions needing to be taken, with the pairs at the top of the list getting/requiring the most immediate attention and top priority in allocating resources  Output \u2013 Actions ranked from high to low     Step 2. Evaluate Recommended Control Options   Although possible controls for each threat and vulnerability pair are arrived at in Step 8 of the Risk Assessment, review the recommended control(s) and alternative solutions for reasonableness and appropriateness. The feasibility (e.g., compatibility, user acceptance, etc.) and effectiveness (e.g., degree of protection and level of risk mitigation) of the recommended controls should be analyzed. In the end, select a \u201cmost appropriate\u201d control option for each threat and vulnerability pair.  Output \u2013 list of feasible controls     Step 3. Conduct Cost-Benefit Analysis   Determine the extent to which a control is cost-effective. Compare the benefit (e.g., risk reduction) of applying a control with its subsequent cost of application. Controls that are not cost-effective are also identified during this step. Analyzing each control or set of controls in this manner, and prioritizing across all controls being considered, can greatly aid in the decision-making process.  Output \u2013 Documented cost-benefit analysis of either implementing or not implementing each specific control     Step 4. Select Control(s)   Taking into account the information and results from previous steps, Ovation\u2019s mission, and other important criteria, the Risk Management Team determines the best control(s) for reducing risks to the information systems and to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI. These controls may consist of a mix of administrative, physical, and/or technical safeguards.  Output \u2013 Selected control(s)     Step 5. Assign Responsibility    Identify the workforce members with the skills necessary to implement each of the specific controls outlined in the previous step, and assign their responsibilities. Also identify the equipment, training and other resources needed for the successful implementation of controls. Resources may include time, money, equipment, etc.  Output \u2013 List of resources, responsible persons and their assignments     Step 6. Develop Safeguard Implementation Plan   Develop an overall implementation or action plan and individual project plans needed to implement the safeguards and controls identified. The Implementation Plan should contain the following information:  Each risk or vulnerability/threat pair and risk level;  Prioritized actions;  The recommended feasible control(s) for each identified risk;  Required resources for implementation of selected controls;  Team member responsible for implementation of each control;  Start date for implementation  Target date for completion of implementation;  Maintenance requirements.    The overall implementation plan provides a broad overview of the safeguard implementation, identifying important milestones and timeframes, resource requirements (staff and other individuals\u2019 time, budget, etc.), interrelationships between projects, and any other relevant information. Regular status reporting of the plan, along with key metrics and success indicators should be reported to Ovation Senior Management.  Individual project plans for safeguard implementation may be developed and contain detailed steps that resources assigned carry out to meet implementation timeframes and expectations. Additionally, consider including items in individual project plans such as a project scope, a list deliverables, key assumptions, objectives, task completion dates and project requirements.  Output \u2013 Safeguard Implementation Plan     Step 7. Implement Selected Controls   As controls are implemented, monitor the affected system(s) to verify that the implemented controls continue to meet expectations. Elimination of all risk is not practical. Depending on individual situations, implemented controls may lower a risk level but not completely eliminate the risk.  Continually and consistently communicate expectations to all Risk Management Team members, as well as senior management and other key people throughout the risk mitigation process. Identify when new risks are identified and when controls lower or offset risk rather than eliminate it.  Additional monitoring is especially crucial during times of major environmental changes, organizational or process changes, or major facilities changes.  If risk reduction expectations are not met, then repeat all or a part of the risk management process so that additional controls needed to lower risk to an acceptable level can be identified.  Output \u2013 Residual Risk documentation     Risk Management Schedule : The two principle components of the risk management process - risk assessment and risk mitigation - will be carried out according to the following schedule to ensure the continued adequacy and continuous improvement of Ovation\u2019s information security program:   Scheduled Basis \u2013 an overall risk assessment of Ovation\u2019s information system infrastructure will be conducted annually. The assessment process should be completed in a timely fashion so that risk mitigation strategies can be determined and included in the corporate budgeting process.  Throughout a System\u2019s Development Life Cycle \u2013 from the time that a need for a new, untested information system configuration and/or application is identified through the time it is disposed of, ongoing assessments of the potential threats to a system and its vulnerabilities should be undertaken as a part of the maintenance of the system.  As Needed \u2013 the Security Officer (or other designated employee) or Risk Management Team may call for a full or partial risk assessment in response to changes in business strategies, information technology, information sensitivity, threats, legal liabilities, or other significant factors that affect Ovation\u2019s Platform.",
