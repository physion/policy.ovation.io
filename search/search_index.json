The Security Rule requires healthcare organizations to implement reasonable hardware, software, and/or procedural mechanisms that record and examine activity in information systems that contain or use ePHI. Audit activities may be limited by application, system, and/or network auditing capabilities and resources. Ovation shall make reasonable and good-faith efforts to safeguard information privacy and security through a well-thought-out approach to auditing that is consistent with available resources. It is the policy of Ovation to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of applications, systems, and networks. To ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place and effective, Ovation shall audit access and activity to detect, report, and guard against: Network vulnerabilities and intrusions; Breaches in confidentiality and security of patient protected health information; Performance problems and flaws in applications; Improper alteration or destruction of ePHI; Out of date software and/or software known to have vulnerabilities.

The Security Officer shall: Assign the task of generating reports for audit activities to the workforce member responsible for the application, system, or network; Assign the task of reviewing the audit reports to the workforce member responsible for the application, system, or network, the Privacy Officer, or any other individual determined to be appropriate for the task; Organize and provide oversight to a team structure charged with audit compliance activities (e.g., parameters, frequency, sample sizes, report formats, evaluation, follow-up, etc.). All connections to Ovation are monitored. Access is limited to certain services, ports, and destinations. Exceptions to these rules, if created, are reviewed on an annual basis. Ovation\u2019s auditing processes shall address access and activity at the following levels listed below. Auditing processes may address date and time of each log-on attempt, date and time of each log-off attempt, devices used, functions performed, etc. User: User level audit trails generally monitor and log all commands directly initiated by the user, all identification and authentication attempts, and data and services accessed. Application: Application level audit trails generally monitor and log all user activities, including data accessed and modified and specific actions. System: System level audit trails generally monitor and log user activities, applications accessed, and other system defined specific actions. Ovation utilizes file system monitoring from OSSEC to assure the integrity of file system data. Network: Network level audit trails generally monitor information on what is operating, penetrations, and vulnerabilities. Ovation shall log all incoming and outgoing traffic to into and out of its environment. This includes all successful and failed attempts at data access and editing. Data associated with this data will include origin, destination, time, and other relevant details that are available to Ovation. Ovation utilizes OSSEC to scan all systems for malicious and unauthorized software every 2 hours and at reboot of systems. Alerts from OSSEC are sent to Kibana, the centralized logging service that we use. Ovation leverages process monitoring tools throughout its environment. Ovation uses OSSEC to monitor the integrity of log files by utilizing OSSEC System Integrity Checking capabilities. Ovation shall identify \u201ctrigger events\u201d or criteria that raise awareness of questionable conditions of viewing of confidential information. The \u201cevents\u201d may be applied to the entire Ovation system or may be specific to a Customer, partner, business associate, or application (See Listing of Potential Trigger Events below). In addition to trigger events, Ovation utilizes OSSEC log correlation functionality to proactively identify and enable alerts based on log data. Logs are reviewed weekly by Security Officer. Ovation\u2019s Security Officer and Privacy Officer are authorized to select and use auditing tools that are designed to detect network vulnerabilities and intrusions. Such tools are explicitly prohibited by others, including Customers and Partners, without the explicit authorization of the Security Officer. These tools may include, but are not limited to: Scanning tools and devices; Password cracking utilities; Network \u201csniffers.\u201d Passive and active intrusion detection systems. The process for review of audit logs, trails, and reports shall include: Description of the activity as well as rationale for performing the audit. Identification of which Ovation workforce members will be responsible for review (workforce members shall not review audit logs that pertain to their own system activity). Frequency of the auditing process. Determination of significant events requiring further review and follow-up. Identification of appropriate reporting channels for audit results and required follow-up. Vulnerability testing software may be used to probe the network to identify what is running (e.g., operating system or product versions in place), whether publicly-known vulnerabilities have been corrected, and evaluate whether the system can withstand attacks aimed at circumventing security controls. Testing may be carried out internally or provided through an external third-party vendor. Whenever possible, a third party auditing vendor should not be providing the organization IT oversight services (e.g., vendors providing IT services should not be auditing their own services - separation of duties). Testing shall be done on a routine basis, currently monthly. Software patches and updates will be applied to all systems in a timely manner. In the case of routine updates, they will be applied after thorough testing. In the case of updates to correct known vulnerabilities, priority will be given to testing to speed the time to production. Critical security patches are applied within 30 days from testing and all patches are applied within 90 days after testing. Audit Requests A request may be made for an audit for a specific cause. The request may come from a variety of sources including, but not limited to, Privacy Officer, Security Officer, Customer, or Partner. A request for an audit for specific cause must include time frame, frequency, and nature of the request. The request must be reviewed and approved by Ovation\u2019s Privacy or Security Officer. A request for an audit must be approved by Ovation\u2019s Privacy Officer and/or Security Officer before proceeding. Under no circumstances shall detailed audit information be shared with parties without proper permissions and access to see such data. Should the audit disclose that a workforce member has accessed ePHI inappropriately, the minimum necessary/least privileged information shall be shared with Ovation\u2019s Security Officer to determine appropriate sanction/ corrective disciplinary action. Only de-identified information shall be shared with Customer or Partner regarding the results of the investigative audit process. This information will be communicated to the appropriate personnel by Ovation\u2019s Privacy Officer or designee. Prior to communicating with customers and partners regarding an audit, it is recommended that Ovation consider seeking risk management and/or legal counsel. Review and Reporting of Audit Findings Audit information that is routinely gathered must be reviewed in a timely manner, currently monthly, by the responsible workforce member(s). The reporting process shall allow for meaningful communication of the audit findings to those workforce members, Customers, or Partners requesting the audit. Significant findings shall be reported immediately in a written format. Ovation\u2019s security incident response form may be utilized to report a single event. Routine findings shall be reported to the sponsoring leadership structure in a written report format. Reports of audit results shall be limited to internal use on a minimum necessary/need-to-know basis. Audit results shall not be disclosed externally without administrative and/or legal counsel approval. Security audits constitute an internal, confidential monitoring practice that may be included in Ovation\u2019s performance improvement activities and reporting. Care shall be taken to ensure that the results of the audits are disclosed to administrative level oversight structures only and that information which may further expose organizational risk is shared with extreme caution. Generic security audit information may be included in organizational reports (individually-identifiable ePHI shall not be included in the reports). Whenever indicated through evaluation and reporting, appropriate corrective actions must be undertaken. These actions shall be documented and shared with the responsible workforce members, Customers, and/or Partners. Auditing Customer and Partner Activity Periodic monitoring of Customer and Partner activity shall be carried out to ensure that access and activity is appropriate for privileges granted and necessary to the arrangement between Ovation and the 3rd party. Ovation will make every effort to assure Customers and Partners do not gain access to data outside of their own Environments. If it is determined that the Customer or Partner has exceeded the scope of access privileges, Ovation\u2019s leadership must remedy the problem immediately. If it is determined that a Customer or Partner has violated the terms of the HIPAA business associate agreement or any terms within the HIPAA regulations, Ovation must take immediate action to remediate the situation. Continued violations may result in discontinuation of the business relationship. Audit Log Security Controls and Backup Audit logs shall be protected from unauthorized access or modification, so the information they contain will be made available only if needed to evaluate a security incident or for routine audit activities as outlined in this policy. All audit logs are encrypted in transit and at rest to control access to the content of the logs. Audit logs shall be stored on a separate system to minimize the impact auditing may have on the privacy system and to prevent access to audit trails by those with system administrator privileges. This is done to apply the security principle of \u201cseparation of duties\u201d to protect audit trails from hackers. Workforce Training, Education, Awareness and Responsibilities Ovation workforce members are provided training, education, and awareness on safeguarding the privacy and security of business and ePHI. Ovation\u2019s commitment to auditing access and activity of the information applications, systems, and networks is communicated through new employee orientation, ongoing training opportunities and events, and applicable policies. Ovation workforce members are made aware of responsibilities with regard to privacy and security of information as well as applicable sanctions/corrective disciplinary actions should the auditing process detect a workforce member\u2019s failure to comply with organizational policies. Ovation Customers are provided with necessary information to understand Ovation auditing capabilities. External Audits of Information Access and Activity Prior to contracting with an external audit firm, Ovation shall: Outline the audit responsibility, authority, and accountability; Choose an audit firm that is independent of other organizational operations; Ensure technical competence of the audit firm staff; Require the audit firm\u2019s adherence to applicable codes of professional ethics; Obtain a signed HIPAA business associate agreement; Assign organizational responsibility for supervision of the external audit firm. Retention of Audit Data Audit logs shall be maintained based on organizational needs. There is no standard or law addressing the retention of audit log/trail information. Retention of this information shall be based on: A. Organizational history and experience. B. Available storage space. Reports summarizing audit activities shall be retained for a period of six years. Log data is currently retained and readily accessible for a 1-month period. Beyond that, log data is available via cold backup. Potential Trigger Events High risk or problem prone incidents or events. Business associate, customer, or partner complaints. Known security vulnerabilities. Atypical patterns of activity. Failed authentication attempts. Remote access use and activity. Activity post termination. Random audits.","title":"Auditing Policy"},{"location":"policies/auditing_policy/#auditing-policy","text":"Ovation shall audit access and activity of electronic protected health information (ePHI) applications and systems in order to ensure compliance.

APPLICABILITY. Customer and Business Associate agree that this BAA applies solely with respect to PHI that Business Associate creates, receives, accesses, uses, maintains or discloses in connection with performing the OvDx Services; it does not apply to other information, including information that would meet the definition of PHI, that Business Associate may create, receive, access, use, maintain or disclose outside of performing the OvDx Services. 3.

Administration and Management of OvDx Services. Business Associate may use or disclose PHI received by Business Associate in its capacity as \"business associate\" of Customer for the proper management and administration of Business Associate. Any such disclosure of PHI shall only be made if Business Associate obtains reasonable assurances from the person to whom the PHI is disclosed that: (1) the PHI will be held confidentially and used or further disclosed only as required by law or for the purpose for which it was disclosed to the person; (2) Business Associate will be notified by such person of any instances of which it becomes aware in which the confidentiality of the PHI has been breached; and (3) the person will provide Business Associate appropriate notice and opportunity to object before disclosing PHI on the basis that such disclosure is required by law. c.

However, if Business Associate is unable to notify Customer for reasons beyond Business Associate\u2019s control, Business Associate may disclose PHI on the basis that such disclosure is required by law so long as Business Associate provides immediate notice to Customer\u2019s Privacy Officer or his/her designee following the disclosure. d. Disclosure to Subcontractors. Business Associate shall ensure that any subcontractors that create, receive, maintain or transmit PHI on behalf of Business Associate agree, in a writing that complies with the requirements of 45 CFR \u00a7164.504(e)(2) through (e)(4), to be bound by the same restrictions and conditions that apply to Business Associate under this BAA with respect to such PHI, including, without limitation, implementing reasonable and appropriate safeguards to protect it. e.

Notice is hereby deemed provided, and no further notice will be provided, for unsuccessful attempts at such unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction, such as pings and other broadcast attacks on a firewall, denial of service attacks, port scans, unsuccessful login attempts, or interception of encrypted information where the key is not compromised, or any combination of the above. e. Reporting of Breaches. Business Associate will report to Customer any Breach of Customer\u2019s Unsecured PHI that Business Associate may discover to the extent required by 45 CFR \u00a7164.410. Business Associate will make such report without unreasonable delay, and in no case later than four (4) hours after discovery by Business Associate of such Breach.

Business Associate may use Converted Data under the following license, which is granted by Customer to Business Associate. Customer and each User hereby grants and agrees to grant an exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, right and license: (i) to freely access, copy, store, process, distribute, transmit, display Converted Data; (ii) use and disclose Converted Data for Business Associate\u2019s business purposes; (iii) to copy, store, process and use such Converted Data to develop, improve, extend and test the Platform and OvDx Services; and (iv) to copy, store, process and use Converted Data to design, develop, distribute, commercialize and use Analytics. Business Associate\u2019s rights and license to use Converted Data shall be exclusive, except that Customer may use Converted Data solely for its internal business purposes. Unless and only to the extent expressly agreed otherwise by Business Associate and Customer in writing, Customer shall not be entitled to any revenue, royalties, or other compensation for Business Associate\u2019s own use or disclosure of such Converted Data. For the avoidance of doubt, Analytics shall not be understood to be the same as or overlap with Converted Data; Customer owns all rights, title and interests in and to Converted Data, and Business Associate owns and retains all rights, title and interests (including without limitation, patent rights, copyright rights, trade secret rights and trademark rights) in and to the Analytics. 8.

MISCELLANEOUS."},{"location":"policies/breach_policy/","text":"Breach Policy To provide guidance for breach notification when impressive or unauthorized access, acquisition, use and/or disclosure of the ePHI occurs. Breach notification will be carried out in compliance with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA)/Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) as well as any other federal or state notification law. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has published breach notification rules for vendors of personal health records as required by ARRA/HITECH. The FTC rule applies to entities not covered by HIPAA, primarily vendors of personal health records. The rule is effective September 24, 2009 with full compliance required by February 22, 2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. Title XIII of ARRA is the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH). HITECH significantly impacts the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules. While HIPAA did not require notification when patient protected health information (PHI) was inappropriately disclosed, covered entities and business associates may have chosen to include notification as part of the mitigation process. HITECH does require notification of certain breaches of unsecured PHI to the following: individuals, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the media. The effective implementation for this provision is September 23, 2009 (pending publication HHS regulations). In the case of a breach, Ovation shall notify all affected Customers. It is the responsibility of the Customers to notify affected individuals.

Ovation shall be deemed to have knowledge of a breach if such breach is known or by exercising reasonable diligence would have been known, to any person, other than the person committing the breach, who is a workforce member or Partner of the organization. Following the discovery of a potential breach, the organization shall begin an investigation (see organizational policies for security incident response and/or risk management incident response) immediately, conduct a risk assessment, and based on the results of the risk assessment, begin the process to notify each Customer affected by the breach. Ovation shall also begin the process of determining what external notifications are required or should be made (e.g., Secretary of Department of Health & Human Services (HHS), media outlets, law enforcement officials, etc.) Breach Investigation: The Ovation Security Officer shall name an individual to act as the investigator of the breach (e.g., privacy officer, security officer, risk manager, etc.). The investigator shall be responsible for the management of the breach investigation, completion of a risk assessment, and coordinating with others in the organization as appropriate (e.g., administration, security incident response team, human resources, risk management, public relations, legal counsel, etc.) The investigator shall be the key facilitator for all breach notification processes to the appropriate entities (e.g., HHS, media, law enforcement officials, etc.). All documentation related to the breach investigation, including the risk assessment, shall be retained for a minimum of six years. Risk Assessment: For an acquisition, access, use or disclosure of ePHI to constitute a breach, it must constitute a violation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. A use or disclosure of ePHI that is incident to an otherwise permissible use or disclosure that occurs despite reasonable safeguards and proper minimum necessary procedures would not be a violation of the Privacy Rule and would not qualify as a potential breach. To determine if an impermissible use or disclosure of ePHI constitutes a breach and requires further notification, the organization will need to perform a risk assessment to determine if there is significant risk of harm to the individual as a result of the impermissible use or disclosure. The organization shall document the risk assessment as part of the investigation in the incident report form noting the outcome of the risk assessment process. The organization has the burden of proof for demonstrating that all notifications to appropriate Customers or that the use or disclosure did not constitute a breach. Based on the outcome of the risk assessment, the organization will determine the need to move forward with breach notification. The risk assessment and the supporting documentation shall be fact specific and address: Consideration of who impermissibly used or to whom the information was impermissibly disclosed; The type and amount of ePHI involved; The cause of the breach, and the entity responsible for the breach, either Customer, Ovation, or Partner. The potential for significant risk of financial, reputational, or other harm. Timeliness of Notification: Upon discovery of a breach, notice shall be made to the affected Ovation Customers no later than 24 hours after the discovery of the breach. It is the responsibility of the organization to demonstrate that all notifications were made as required, including evidence demonstrating the necessity of delay. Delay of Notification Authorized for Law Enforcement Purposes: If a law enforcement official states to the organization that a notification, notice, or posting would impede a criminal investigation or cause damage to national security, the organization shall: If the statement is in writing and specifies the time for which a delay is required, delay such notification, notice, or posting of the time period specified by the official; or If the statement is made orally, document the statement, including the identify of the official making the statement, and delay the notification, notice, or posting temporarily and no longer than 30 days from the date of the oral statement, unless a written statement as described above is submitted during that time. Content of the Notice: The notice shall be written in plain language and must contain the following information: A brief description of what happened, including the date of the breach and the date of the discovery of the breach, if known; A description of the types of unsecured protected health information that were involved in the breach (such as whether full name, Social Security number, date of birth, home address, account number, diagnosis, disability code or other types of information were involved), if known; Any steps the Customer should take to protect Customer data from potential harm resulting from the breach. A brief description of what Ovation is doing to investigate the breach, to mitigate harm to individuals and Customers, and to protect against further breaches. Contact procedures for individuals to ask questions or learn additional information, which may include a toll-free telephone number, an e-mail address, a web site, or postal address. Methods of Notification: Ovation Customers will be notified via email and phone within the timeframe for reporting breaches, as outlined above. Maintenance of Breach Information/Log: As described above and in addition to the reports created for each incident, Ovation shall maintain a process to record or log all breaches of unsecured ePHI regardless of the number of records and Customers affected. The following information should be collected/logged for each breach: A description of what happened, including the date of the breach, the date of the discovery of the breach, and the number of records and Customers affected, if known. A description of the types of unsecured protected health information that were involved in the breach (such as full name, Social Security number, date of birth, home address, account number, etc.), if known. A description of the action taken with regard to notification of patients regarding the breach. Resolution steps taken to mitigate the breach and prevent future occurrences. Workforce Training: Ovation shall train all members of its workforce on the policies and procedures with respect to ePHI as necessary and appropriate for the members to carry out their job responsibilities. Workforce members shall also be trained as to how to identify and report breaches within the organization. Complaints: Ovation must provide a process for individuals to make complaints concerning the organization\u2019s patient privacy policies and procedures or its compliance with such policies and procedures. Sanctions: The organization shall have in place and apply appropriate sanctions against members of its workforce, Customers, and Partners who fail to comply with privacy policies and procedures. Retaliation/Waiver: Ovation may not intimidate, threaten, coerce, discriminate against, or take other retaliatory action against any individual for the exercise by the individual of any privacy right. The organization may not require individuals to waive their privacy rights under as a condition of the provision of treatment, payment, enrollment in a health plan, or eligibility for benefits. Ovation Customer Responsibilities The Ovation Customer that accesses, maintains, retains, modifies, records, stores, destroys, or otherwise holds, uses, or discloses unsecured ePHI shall, without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of a breach, notify Ovation of such breach. The Customer shall provide Ovation with the following information: A description of what happened, including the date of the breach, the date of the discovery of the breach, and the number of records and Customers affected, if known.

Breach notification will be carried out in compliance with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA)/Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) as well as any other federal or state notification law. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has published breach notification rules for vendors of personal health records as required by ARRA/HITECH. The FTC rule applies to entities not covered by HIPAA, primarily vendors of personal health records. The rule is effective September 24, 2009 with full compliance required by February 22, 2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. Title XIII of ARRA is the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH). HITECH significantly impacts the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules. While HIPAA did not require notification when patient protected health information (PHI) was inappropriately disclosed, covered entities and business associates may have chosen to include notification as part of the mitigation process. HITECH does require notification of certain breaches of unsecured PHI to the following: individuals, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the media.

This Disaster Recovery Policy is maintained by the Ovation Security Officer and Privacy Officer. The following objectives have been established for this plan: Maximize the effectiveness of contingency operations through an established plan that consists of the following phases: Notification/Activation phase to detect and assess damage and to activate the plan; Recovery phase to restore temporary IT operations and recover damage done to the original system; Reconstitution phase to restore IT system processing capabilities to normal operations. Identify the activities, resources, and procedures needed to carry out Ovation processing requirements during prolonged interruptions to normal operations. Identify and define the impact of interruptions to Ovation systems. Assign responsibilities to designated personnel and provide guidance for recovering Ovation during prolonged periods of interruption to normal operations. Ensure coordination with other Ovation staff who will participate in the contingency planning strategies. Ensure coordination with external points of contact and vendors who will participate in the contingency planning strategies. This Ovation Contingency Plan has been developed as required under the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, Appendix III, November 2000, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Final Security Rule, Section \u00a7164.308(a)(7), which requires the establishment and implementation of procedures for responding to events that damage systems containing electronic protected health information. This Ovation Contingency Plan is created under the legislative requirements set forth in the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 and the guidelines established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-34, titled \"Contingency Planning Guide for Information Technology Systems\" dated June 2002. The Ovation Contingency Plan also complies with the following federal and departmental policies: The Computer Security Act of 1987; OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, Appendix III, November 2000; Federal Preparedness Circular (FPC) 65, Federal Executive Branch Continuity of Operations, July 1999; Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) 67, Enduring Constitutional Government and Continuity of Government Operations, October 1998; PDD 63, Critical Infrastructure Protection, May 1998; Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), The Federal Response Plan (FRP), April 1999; Defense Authorization Act (Public Law 106-398), Title X, Subtitle G, \u201cGovernment Information Security Reform,\u201d October 30, 2000 Example of the types of disasters that would initiate this plan are natural disaster, political disturbances, man made disaster, external human threats, internal malicious activities. Ovation defined two categories of systems from a disaster recovery perspective. Critical Systems . These systems host application servers and database servers or are required for functioning of systems that host application servers and database servers. These systems, if unavailable, affect the integrity of data and must be restored, or have a process begun to restore them, immediately upon becoming unavailable. Non-critical Systems . These are all systems not considered critical by definition above. These systems, while they may affect the performance and overall security of critical systems, do not prevent Critical systems from functioning and being accessed appropriately. These systems are restored at a lower priority than critical systems.

The Ops Team is responsible for recovery of the Ovation hosted environment, network devices, and all servers. Members of the team include personnel who are also responsible for the daily operations and maintenance of Ovation. The team leader is the Chief Architect and directs the Dev Ops Team. The Web Services Team is responsible for assuring all application servers, and web services are working. It is also responsible for testing redeployments and assessing damage to the environment. The team leader is the Chief Architect and directs the Web Services Team. Testing and Maintenance The CTO and Chief Architect shall establish criteria for validation/testing of a Contingency Plan, an annual test schedule, and ensure implementation of the test. This process will also serve as training for personnel involved in the plan\u2019s execution. At a minimum the Contingency Plan shall be tested annually (within 365 days). The types of validation/testing exercises include tabletop and technical testing. Contingency Plans for all application systems must be tested at a minimum using the tabletop testing process. However, if the application system Contingency Plan is included in the technical testing of their respective support systems that technical test will satisfy the annual requirement. Tabletop Testing Tabletop Testing is conducted in accordance with the the CMS Risk Management Handbook, Volume 2 . The primary objective of the tabletop test is to ensure designated personnel are knowledgeable and capable of performing the notification/activation requirements and procedures as outlined in the CP, in a timely manner. The exercises include, but are not limited to: Testing to validate the ability to respond to a crisis in a coordinated, timely, and effective manner, by simulating the occurrence of a specific crisis. Technical Testing The primary objective of the technical test is to ensure the communication processes and data storage and recovery processes can function at an alternate site to perform the functions and capabilities of the system within the designated requirements. Technical testing shall include, but is not limited to: Process from backup system at the alternate site; Restore system using backups; and Switch compute and storage resources to alternate processing site. 1. Notification and Activation Phase This phase addresses the initial actions taken to detect and assess damage inflicted by a disruption to Ovation. Based on the assessment of the Event, sometimes according to the Ovation Incident Response Policy, the Contingency Plan may be activated by either the CTO or Chief Architect. The notification sequence is listed below: The first responder is to notify the CTO. All known information must be relayed to the CTO. The Chief Architect is to contact the Web Services Team and inform them of the event. The CTO is to to begin assessment procedures. The CTO is to notify team members and direct them to complete the assessment procedures outlined below to determine the extent of damage and estimated recovery time. If damage assessment cannot be performed locally because of unsafe conditions, the CTO is to follow the steps below. Damage Assessment Procedures: The CTO and Chief Architect are to logically assess damage, gain insight into whether the infrastructure is salvageable, and begin to formulate a plan for recovery. Alternate Assessment Procedures: Upon notification from the CTO, the Chief Architect is to follow the procedures for damage assessment with combined DevOps and Web Services Teams. The Ovation Contingency Plan is to be activated if one or more of the following criteria are met: Ovation will be unavailable for more than 48 hours. Hosting facility is damaged and will be unavailable for more than 24 hours. Other criteria, as appropriate and as defined by Ovation. If the plan is to be activated, the CTO is to notify and inform team members of the details of the event and if relocation is required. Upon notification from the CTO, group leaders and managers are to notify their respective teams. Team members are to be informed of all applicable information and prepared to respond and relocate if necessary. The CTO is to notify the hosting facility partners that a contingency event has been declared and to ship the necessary materials (as determined by damage assessment) to the alternate site. The CTO is to notify remaining personnel and executive leadership on the general status of the incident. Notification can be message, email, or phone. 2. Recovery Phase This section provides procedures for recovering the application at an alternate site, whereas other efforts are directed to repair damage to the original system and capabilities. The following procedures are for recovering the Ovation infrastructure at the alternate site. Procedures are outlined per team required. Each procedure should be executed in the sequence it is presented to maintain efficient operations. Recovery Goal: The goal is to rebuild Ovation infrastructure to a production state. The tasks outlines below are not sequential and some can be run in parallel. Contact Partners and Customers affected - Web Services Assess damage to the environment - Web Services Begin replication of new environment using automated and tested scripts, currently Datica and/or AWS Elastic Beanstalk environments. A this point it is determined whether to recover in AWS or in Datica. - Dev Ops Test new environment using pre-written tests - Web Services Test logging, security, and alerting functionality - Dev Ops Deploy environment to production - Web Services Update DNS to new environment. - Dev Ops 3. Reconstitution Phase This section discusses activities necessary for restoring Ovation operations at the original or new site. The goal is to restore full operations within 24 hours of a disaster or outage. When the hosted data center at the original or new site has been restored, Ovation operations at the alternate site may be transitioned back. The goal is to provide a seamless transition of operations from the alternate site to the computer center. Original or New Site Restoration Begin replication of new environment using automated and tested scrips, currently Datica and/or AWS Elastic Beanstalk environments. - Dev Ops Test new environment using pre-written tests. - Web Services Test logging, security, and alerting functionality. - Dev Ops Deploy environment to production - Web Services Update DNS to new environment. - Dev Ops Plan Deactivation If the Ovation environment is moved back to the original site from the alternative site, all hardware used at the alternate site should be handled and disposed of according to the Ovation Media Disposal Policy.","title":"Disaster Recovery Policy"},{"location":"policies/disaster_recovery_policy/#disaster-recovery-policy","text":"The Ovation Contingency Plan establishes procedures to recover Ovation following a disruption resulting from a disaster.

Sharing Service Data. Ovation does not review the substance of Service Data and does not control the use of Service Data that has been provided to Ovation. Authentication of the true identity of Internet users is difficult, and so Ovation cannot and does not confirm that any user in the provenance of Service Data is the person or entity who they claim to be. Accordingly, Ovation makes no representation or warranty, and assumes no liability, regarding the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability or appropriateness of any such Service Data.

PAYMENTS Fees. Customer shall pay Ovation the fees described in the Contract and each Statement of Work, in the amounts and at the times set forth therein, and as otherwise stated in these Terms of Service. Fees may be specified as being payable in advance or in arrears; fees may be fixed, contingent or variable (e.g., depending on usage factors or per sample charges); and fees may be specified on a recurring basis (e.g., subscription fees and/or usage fees, which may be payable monthly, quarterly or annually) or non-recurring basis (e.g., one-time activation fees). Recurring Fees. Recurring fees (e.g., subscription fees and/or usage fees) must be paid by an automatic payment method (credit card or ACH bank transfer) which may be stored. Generally, recurring fees will be automatically charged on such stored payment method 15 days following invoicing. Customer will receive an invoice (by email) of all recurring fees (whether from Ovation or from a partner of Ovation) for current billing period. By choosing a plan with recurring fees, Customer acknowledges that such recurring fees have an initial and recurring payment feature and Customer accepts responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. OVATION MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM CUSTOMER, UNTIL CUSTOMER PROVIDES PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH WILL BE CONFIRMED IN WRITING BY OVATION) THAT CUSTOMER HAS TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISHES TO CHANGE CUSTOMER\u2019S PAYMENT METHOD. SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE OVATION REASONABLY COULD ACT. CUSTOMER MAY TERMINATE ITS AUTHORIZATION OR CHANGE ITS PAYMENT METHOD, BY VISITING CUSTOMER\u2019S ACCOUNT SETTINGS ON THE SITE. Customer hereby accepts all credit card or ACH payment charges that comply with these Terms of Service. Payment Terms. Ovation may collect payments from Customer directly or use a third-party payment processor ( Payment Processor ) to bill Customer through a payment account linked to Customer\u2019s Account for use of the Service. The processing of payments by a Payment Processor will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of such Payment Processor in addition to these Terms of Service and the Contract or applicable Statement of Work. Ovation shall not be responsible for error by the Payment Processor. Unless specified otherwise, all amounts due hereunder shall be paid in full (without deduction, set-off or counterclaim) within 15 days after invoice in US dollars at Ovation's address or to an account specified by Ovation. Past due amounts shall bear a late payment charge, until paid, at the rate of 1.0% per month or the maximum amount permitted by law, whichever is less. If any payment is past due, Ovation shall have the right to take whatever action it deems appropriate (including without limitation, disabling the Account, suspending User access to the Service, or terminating the Contract pursuant to Section 10). Without limiting the foregoing, if Ovation, through the Payment Processor, does not receive payment from Customer, Customer agrees to pay all amounts due on its Account upon demand. Customer agrees to reimburse Ovation for all costs (including attorneys' fees) incurred in collecting late payments. Taxes. All payments required by these Terms of Service are exclusive of federal, state, local and foreign taxes, duties, tariffs, levies, withholdings and similar assessments (including without limitation, sales taxes, use taxes and value added taxes), and Customer agrees to bear and be responsible for the payment of all such charges, excluding taxes based upon Ovation\u2019s net income. All amounts due hereunder shall be grossed-up for any withholding taxes imposed by any foreign government. If Customer claims exemption from any tax, then it shall furnish Ovation with a valid tax exemption certificate issued by or acceptable to the applicable taxing jurisdiction or entity. Current Billing Information Required. CUSTOMER MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE BILLING INFORMATION FOR ITS ACCOUNT. CUSTOMER MUST PROMPTLY UPDATE ALL RELEVANT INFORMATION TO KEEP ITS ACCOUNT CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING ADDRESS, CREDIT CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE), AND CUSTOMER MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY OVATION OR THE PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF CUSTOMER\u2019S PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF CUSTOMER BECOMES AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF A USER NAME OR PASSWORD. CHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE MADE AT CUSTOMER\u2019S ACCOUNT SETTINGS ON THE SITE. IF CUSTOMER FAILS TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, CUSTOMER AGREES THAT OVATION MAY CONTINUE CHARGING CUSTOMER FOR ANY RECURRING FEES UNDER CUSTOMER\u2019S BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS CUSTOMER HAS TERMINATED OR CANCELED ITS USE OF THE SERVICE. 5. CONFIDENTIALITY Scope. The term Confidential Information means all trade secrets, know-how, inventions, software and other financial, business, scientific, clinical or technical information and data disclosed by or for a party in connection with using or providing the Service.

Each party shall be responsible for any breach of confidentiality by its personnel (including Users, in the case of Customer). Promptly after any termination (or at the disclosing party's request at any other time), the receiving party shall return all of the other's tangible Confidential Information, permanently erase all Confidential Information from any storage media and destroy all information, records and materials developed therefrom (except Confidential Information stored in accordance with automated backup procedures in the ordinary course of business). Each party may disclose only the general nature, but not the specific terms, of any Contract without the prior consent of the other party; provided , Customer or Ovation may provide a copy of the Contract or otherwise disclose its terms in connection with any legal or regulatory requirement, audit, financing transaction or due diligence inquiry. Compelled Disclosures. These restrictions will not prevent either party from complying with any law, regulation, court order, demand by law enforcement or other legal requirement or investigation that purports to compel disclosure of any Service Data or other Confidential Information. The receiving party will promptly notify the disclosing party upon learning of any such legal requirement, and cooperate with the disclosing party in the exercise of its right to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information before any tribunal or governmental agency. 6.

PAYMENTS Fees. Customer shall pay Ovation the fees described in the Contract and each Statement of Work, in the amounts and at the times set forth therein, and as otherwise stated in these Terms of Service.

Recurring Fees. Recurring fees (e.g., subscription fees and/or usage fees) must be paid by an automatic payment method (credit card or ACH bank transfer). Generally, recurring fees will be billed monthly, in arrears. Customer will receive notice (by email) of all recurring fees (whether from Ovation or from a partner of Ovation) for current billing period by the third business day of the following month.

All payments required by these Terms of Service are exclusive of federal, state, local and foreign taxes, duties, tariffs, levies, withholdings and similar assessments (including without limitation, sales taxes, use taxes and value added taxes), and Customer agrees to bear and be responsible for the payment of all such charges, excluding taxes based upon Ovation\u2019s net income. All amounts due hereunder shall be grossed-up for any withholding taxes imposed by any foreign government. If Customer claims exemption from any tax, then it shall furnish Ovation with a valid tax exemption certificate issued by or acceptable to the applicable taxing jurisdiction or entity. 5. CONFIDENTIALITY Scope. The term Confidential Information means all trade secrets, know-how, inventions, software and other financial, business, scientific, clinical or technical information and data disclosed by or for a party in connection with using or providing the Service.

Confidentiality. Except for the specific rights granted by these Terms of Service, and except for disclosures that are necessary to comply with any legal, regulatory, law enforcement or similar requirement or investigation, the receiving party shall not access, reproduce, use or disclose any of the other party's Confidential Information without its written consent, and shall use reasonable care to protect the other's Confidential Information from unauthorized access, use and disclosure (including by ensuring that its personnel who access any Confidential Information have a need to know for the permitted purpose and are bound by written obligations that are at least as protective as these Terms of Service).

If and only if (a) Customer is a Covered Entity, (b) Customer notifies Ovation in writing that all or any part of the Service Data constitutes PHI and (c) Ovation qualifies as a Business Associate of Customer as a result of the Service and/or Work provided hereunder, then the terms and conditions in the Business Associate Agreement shall apply as of the date all such conditions are met ( BAA Effective Date ). Otherwise, the Business Associate Agreement shall not have any force or effect. Compelled Disclosures. These restrictions will not prevent either party from complying with any law, regulation, court order, demand by law enforcement or other legal requirement or investigation that purports to compel disclosure of any Service Data or other Confidential Information. The receiving party will promptly notify the disclosing party upon learning of any such legal requirement, and cooperate with the disclosing party in the exercise of its right to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information before any tribunal or governmental agency. 6.

Ovation. Ovation agrees to defend Customer and Users ( Customer Indemnitees ) against any demand, suit, action or other claim by any third party that the Service or any Deliverable misappropriates or infringes its intellectual property rights, and to indemnify Customer Indemnitees for liabilities (as specified in settlements or judgment awards) that result from such claims. If the Service or any Deliverable becomes or, in Ovation's opinion, is likely to become the subject of an injunction or other claim preventing its use as contemplated herein, Ovation may, at its option and expense (a) obtain the rights needed to continue providing the Service or using the Deliverable, or (b) replace or modify the Service or Deliverable without substantially compromising its principal functions.

For clarity, all Service Data will be treated as Customer\u2019s or User's Confidential Information, and all Feedback, Ovation IP and pricing information will be treated as Ovation\u2019s Confidential Information. Confidentiality. Except for the specific rights granted by these Terms of Service, and except for disclosures that are necessary to comply with any legal, regulatory, law enforcement or similar requirement or investigation, the receiving party shall not access, reproduce, use or disclose any of the other party's Confidential Information without its written consent, and shall use reasonable care to protect the other's Confidential Information from unauthorized access, use and disclosure (including by ensuring that its personnel who access any Confidential Information have a need to know for the permitted purpose and are bound by written obligations that are at least as protective as these Terms of Service). Each party shall be responsible for any breach of confidentiality by its personnel (including Users, in the case of Customer). Promptly after any termination (or at the disclosing party's request at any other time), the receiving party shall, unless otherwise agreed, return all of the other's tangible Confidential Information, erase Confidential Information from any storage media and destroy information, records and materials developed therefrom (except Confidential Information stored in accordance with automated backup procedures in the ordinary course of business). Each party may disclose only the general nature, but not the specific terms, of any Contract without the prior consent of the other party; provided , Customer or Ovation may provide a copy of the Contract or otherwise disclose its terms in connection with any legal or regulatory requirement, audit, financing transaction or due diligence inquiry.

If and only if (a) Customer is a Covered Entity, (b) Customer notifies Ovation in writing that all or any part of the Service Data constitutes PHI and (c) Ovation qualifies as a Business Associate of Customer as a result of the Service and/or Work provided hereunder, then the terms and conditions in the Business Associate Agreement shall apply as of the date all such conditions are met ( BAA Effective Date ). Otherwise, the Business Associate Agreement shall not have any force or effect. Compelled Disclosures. These restrictions will not prevent either party from complying with any law, regulation, court order, demand by law enforcement or other legal requirement or investigation that purports to compel disclosure of any Service Data or other Confidential Information. The receiving party will promptly notify the disclosing party upon learning of any such legal requirement, and cooperate with the disclosing party in the exercise of its right to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information before any tribunal or governmental agency.","title":"5.

Process flows are a direct representation of the SANS process. Review Appendix 1 for a flowchart identifying each phase. Identification Phase Immediately upon observation Ovation members report suspected and known Precursors, Events, Indications, and Incidents in one of the following ways: Direct report to management, the Security Officer, Privacy Officer, or other; Email; Phone call; Secure Chat. Anonymously through workforce members desired channels. The individual receiving the report facilitates completion of an Incident Identification form and notifies the Security Officer (if not already done). The Security Officer determines if the issue is a Precursor, Event, Indication or Incident. If the issue is an event, indication, or precursor the Security Officer forwards it to the appropriate resource for resolution. Non-Technical Event (minor infringement): the Security Officer completes a SIR Form (see Appendix 2) and investigates the incident. Technical Event: Assign the issue to an IT resource for resolution. This resource may also be a contractor or outsourced technical resource, in the event of a small office or lack of expertise in the area. If the issue is a security incident the Security Officer activates the Security Incident Response Team (SIRT) and notifies senior management. If a non-technical security incident is discovered the SIRT completes the investigation, implements preventative measures, and resolves the security incident. Once the investigation is completed, progress to Phase V, Follow-up. If the issue is a technical security incident, commence to Phase II: Containment. The Containment, Eradication, and Recovery Phases are highly technical. It is important to have them completed by a highly qualified technical security resource with oversight by the SIRT team. Each individual on the SIRT and the technical security resource document all measures taken during each phase, including the start and end times of all efforts. The lead member of the SIRT team facilitates initiation of a Security Incident Report (SIR) Form (See Appendix 2 for sample format) or an Incident Survey Form (See Appendix 4). The intent of the SIR form is to provide a summary of all events, efforts, and conclusions of each Phase of this policy and procedures. The Security Officer, Privacy Officer, or Ovation representative appointed notifies any affected Customers and Partners. If no Customers and Partners are affected, notification is at the discretion of the Security and Privacy Officer. In the case of a threat identified, the Security Officer is to form a team to investigate and involve necessary resources, both internal to Ovation and potentially external. Containment Phase (Technical) In this Phase, Ovation\u2019s IT department attempts to contain the security incident. It is extremely important to take detailed notes during the security incident response process. This provides that the evidence gathered during the security incident can be used successfully during prosecution, if appropriate. The SIRT reviews any information that has been collected by the Security Officer or any other individual investigating the security incident. The SIRT secures the network perimeter. The IT department performs the following: Securely connect to the affected system over a trusted connection. Retrieve any volatile data from the affected system. Determine the relative integrity and the appropriateness of backing the system up. If appropriate, back up the system. Change the password(s) to the affected system(s). Determine whether it is safe to continue operations with the affect system(s). If it is safe, allow the system to continue to function; Complete any documentation relative to the security incident on the SIR Form. Move to Phase V, Follow-up. If it is NOT safe to allow the system to continue operations, discontinue the system(s) operation and move to Phase III, Eradication. The individual completing this phase provides written communication to the SIRT. Continuously apprise Senior Management of progress. Continue to notify affected Customers and Partners with relevant updates as needed Eradication Phase (Technical) The Eradication Phase represents the SIRT\u2019s effort to remove the cause, and the resulting security exposures, that are now on the affected system(s). Determine symptoms and cause related to the affected system(s). Strengthen the defenses surrounding the affected system(s), where possible (a risk assessment may be needed and can be determined by the Security Officer). This may include the following: An increase in network perimeter defenses. An increase in system monitoring defenses. Remediation (\u201cfixing\u201d) any security issues within the affected system, such as removing unused services/general host hardening techniques. Conduct a detailed vulnerability assessment to verify all the holes/gaps that can be exploited have been addressed. If additional issues or symptoms are identified, take appropriate preventative measures to eliminate or minimize potential future compromises. Complete the Eradication Form (see Appendix 4). Update the documentation with the information learned from the vulnerability assessment, including the cause, symptoms, and the method used to fix the problem with the affected system(s). Apprise Senior Management of the progress. Continue to notify affected Customers and Partners with relevant updates as needed. Move to Phase IV, Recovery. Recovery Phase (Technical) The Recovery Phase represents the SIRT\u2019s effort to restore the affected system(s) back to operation after the resulting security exposures, if any, have been corrected. The technical team determines if the affected system(s) have been changed in any way. If they have, the technical team restores the system to its proper, intended functioning (\u201clast known good\u201d). Once restored, the team validates that the system functions the way it was intended/had functioned in the past. This may require the involvement of the business unit that owns the affected system(s). If operation of the system(s) had been interrupted (i.e., the system(s) had been taken offline or dropped from the network while triaged), restart the restored and validated system(s) and monitor for behavior. If the system had not been changed in any way, but was taken offline (i.e., operations had been interrupted), restart the system and monitor for proper behavior. Update the documentation with the detail that was determined during this phase. Apprise Senior Management of progress. Continue to notify affected Customers and Partners with relevant updates as needed. Move to Phase V, Follow-up. Follow-up Phase (Technical and Non-Technical) The Follow-up Phase represents the review of the security incident to look for \u201clessons learned\u201d and to determine whether the process that was taken could have been improved in any way. It is recommended all security incidents be reviewed shortly after resolution to determine where response could be improved. Timeframes may extend to one to two weeks post-incident. Responders to the security incident (SIRT Team and technical security resource) meet to review the documentation collected during the security incident. Create a \u201clessons learned\u201d document and attach it to the completed SIR Form. Evaluate the cost and impact of the security incident to Ovation using the documents provided by the SIRT and the technical security resource. Determine what could be improved. Communicate these findings to Senior Management for approval and for implementation of any recommendations made post-review of the security incident. Carry out recommendations approved by Senior Management; sufficient budget, time and resources should be committed to this activity. Close the security incident. Periodic Evaluation It is important to note that the processes surrounding security incident response should be periodically reviewed and evaluated for effectiveness. This also involves appropriate training of resources expected to respond to security incidents, as well as the training of the general population regarding the Ovation\u2019s expectation for them, relative to security responsibilities. The incident response plan is tested annually.

Once the investigation is completed, progress to Phase V, Follow-up. If the issue is a technical security incident, commence to Phase II: Containment. The Containment, Eradication, and Recovery Phases are highly technical. It is important to have them completed by a highly qualified technical security resource with oversight by the SIRT team. Each individual on the SIRT and the technical security resource document all measures taken during each phase, including the start and end times of all efforts. The lead member of the SIRT team facilitates initiation of a Security Incident Report (SIR) Form (See Appendix 2 for sample format) or an Incident Survey Form (See Appendix 4). The intent of the SIR form is to provide a summary of all events, efforts, and conclusions of each Phase of this policy and procedures. The Security Officer, Privacy Officer, or Ovation representative appointed notifies any affected Customers and Partners. If no Customers and Partners are affected, notification is at the discretion of the Security and Privacy Officer. In the case of a threat identified, the Security Officer is to form a team to investigate and involve necessary resources, both internal to Ovation and potentially external.","title":"Identification Phase"},{"location":"policies/incident_response_policy/#containment-phase-technical","text":"In this Phase, Ovation\u2019s IT department attempts to contain the security incident.

To avoid a breach of the confidential process or key, these decryption tools should be stored on a device or at a location separate from the data they are used to encrypt or decrypt. The following encryption processes meet this standard. Valid encryption processes for data at rest (i.e. data that resides in databases, file systems and other structured storage systems) are consistent with NIST Special Publication 800-111, Guide to Storage Encryption Technologies for End User Devices. Valid encryption processes for data in motion (i.e. data that is moving through a network, including wireless transmission) are those that comply, as appropriate, with NIST Special Publications 800-52, Guidelines for the Selection and Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) Implementations; 800-77, Guide to IPSec VPNs; or 800-113, Guide to SSL VPNs, and may include others which are Federal Information Processing Standards FIPS 140-2 validated. The media on which the PHI is stored or recorded has been destroyed in the following ways: Paper, film, or other hard copy media have been shredded or destroyed such that the PHI cannot be read or otherwise cannot be reconstructed. Redaction is specifically excluded as a means of data destruction. Electronic media have been cleared, purged, or destroyed consistent with NIST Special Publications 800-88, Guidelines for Media Sanitization, such that the PHI cannot be retrieved. Vendors : Persons from other organizations marketing or selling products or services, or providing services to Ovation.

Any disclosures under this section will be made only if Business Associate obtains reasonable assurances from the recipient of the PHI that (i) the recipient will hold the PHI confidentially and will use or disclose the PHI only as required by law or for the purpose for which it was disclosed to the recipient, and (ii) the recipient will notify Business Associate of any instances of which it is aware in which the confidentiality of the information has been breached. Obligations of Business Associate. Limit on Uses and Disclosures. Business Associate will use or disclose PHI only as permitted by this BAA or as required by law, provided that any such use or disclosure would not violate HIPAA if done by a Covered Entity, unless permitted for a Business Associate under HIPAA. Safeguards. Business Associate will use reasonable and appropriate safeguards to prevent Use or Disclosure of PHI other than as provided for by this BAA, consistent with the requirements of Subpart C of 45 C.F.R. Part 164 (with respect to Electronic PHI) as determined by Business Associate and as reflected in the PaaS Agreement, which includes Disk Encryption and Encryption In-Transit services. Reporting. For all reporting obligations under this BAA, the parties acknowledge that, because Business Associate does not know the details of PHI contained in any of Customer Applications, there will be no obligation on the Business Associate to provide information about the identities of the Individuals who may have been affected, or a description of the type of information that may have been subject to a Security Incident, Impermissible Use or Disclosure, or Breach. Business Associate will ensure Customer access to Audit Logging to help Customer in addressing Customer\u2019s obligations for reporting under this BAA. Customer acknowledges Business Associate is under no obligation to provide additional support for Customer\u2019s BAA reporting obligations but may choose to provide such additional services at its sole discretion or at Customer expense. Reporting of Impermissible Uses and Disclosures. Business Associate will report to Customer any Use or Disclosure of PHI not permitted or required by this BAA of which Business Associate becomes aware. Reporting of Security Incidents. Business Associate will report to Customer on no less than fourteen business (14) days from the date any Security Incidents involving PHI of which Business Associate becomes aware in which there is a successful unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction of information or interference with system operations in an Information System in a manner that risks the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of such information. Notice is hereby deemed provided, and no further notice will be provided, for unsuccessful attempts at such unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction, such as pings and other broadcast attacks on a firewall, denial of service attacks, port scans, unsuccessful login attempts, or interception of encrypted information where the key is not compromised, or any combination of the above. Reporting of Breaches. Business Associate will report to Customer any Breach of Customer\u2019s Unsecured PHI that Business Associate may discover to the extent required by 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 164.410.

Business Associate undertakes no obligation to report network security related incidents which occur on its managed network but does not directly involve Customer\u2019s use of Hosting Services. Subcontractors. Business Associate will ensure that any subcontractors that create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI on behalf of Business Associate agree to restrictions and conditions at least as stringent as those found in this BAA, and agree to implement reasonable and appropriate safeguards to protect PHI. Access to PHI. Customer acknowledges that Business Associate is not required by this BAA to make disclosures of PHI to Individuals or any person other than Customer, and that Business Associate does not, therefore, expect to maintain documentation of such disclosure as described in 45 CFR \u00a7 164.528. In the event that Business Associate does make such disclosure, it shall document the disclosure as would be required for Customer to respond to a request by an Individual for an accounting of disclosures in accordance with 45 CFR \u00a7164.504(e)(2)(ii)(G) and \u00a7164.528, and shall provide such documentation to Customer promptly on Customer\u2019s request.

Business Associate will make available to Customer the information required to provide an accounting of Disclosures in accordance with 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 164.528 of which Business Associate is aware, if requested by Customer. Because Business Associate cannot readily identify which Individuals are identified or what types of PHI are included in Customer Content, Customer will be solely responsible for identifying which Individuals, if any, may have been included in Customer Content that Provider has disclosed and for providing a brief description of the PHI disclosed. Internal Records. Provider will make its internal practices, books, and records relating to the Use and Disclosure of PHI available to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d) for purposes of determining Customer compliance with HIPAA. Nothing in this section will waive any applicable privilege or protection, including with respect to trade secrets and confidential commercial information. Customer\u2019s Obligations: Appropriate Use of HIPAA Accounts. Customer is responsible for implementing appropriate privacy and security safeguards in order to protect PHI in compliance with HIPAA and this BAA. Without limitation, Customer shall: (i) not include protected health information (as defined in 45 CFR 160.103) in any Services that are not or cannot be HIPAA compliant, (ii) utilize the highest level of audit logging in connection with its use of all Customer Applications, and (iii) maintain the maximum retention of logs in connection with its use of all Services. HIPAA Account Appropriate Configurations: Customer is solely responsible for configuring, and will configure, all Customer Applications as follows: Encryption. Customer shall encrypt all PHI stored or transmitted outside the Services in accordance with the Secretary of HHS\u2019s Guidance to Render Unsecured Protected Health Information Unusable, Unreadable, or Indecipherable to Unauthorized Individuals, available at http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/breachnotificationrule/brguidance.html, as it may be updated from time to time, and as may be made available on any successor or related site designated by HHS. SSL Termination: All services must be served via SSL. Customer is responsible for providing, maintaining and updating a valid SSL certificate for use with the Service. SSL certificates must be a minimum of 4096 bit key size. Customer agrees to comply with Business Associate\u2019s requirements regarding SSL termination. Necessary Consents. Customer warrants that it has obtained any necessary authorizations, consents, and other permissions that may be required under applicable law prior to placing Customer Content, including without limitation PHI, on the Services. Restrictions on Disclosures. Customer shall not agree to any restriction requests or place any restrictions in any notice of privacy practices that would cause Business Associate to violate this BAA or any applicable law. Compliance with HIPAA. Customer shall not request or cause Business Associate to make a Use or Disclosure of PHI in a manner that does not comply with HIPAA or this BAA. Term and Termination Term. The term of this BAA will commence on the PaaS Agreement Effective Date and will remain in effect until the earlier of the termination of the PaaS Agreement or notification by Customer that an account is no longer subject to this BAA. Effect of Termination. At termination of this BAA, Business Associate, if feasible, will return or destroy all PHI that Business Associate still maintains, if any. If return or destruction is not feasible, Business Associate will extend the protections of this Agreement to the PHI, limit further uses and disclosures to those purposes that make the return of the PHI infeasible, and make not further use or disclosure of PHI. If Customer requests contemporaneously with any termination event or notice, Business Associate will allow Customer to have access to Customer\u2019s account for a reasonable period of time following termination as necessary for Customer to retrieve or delete any PHI at its then current monthly recurring rate; provided, however, that if the security of Customer\u2019s servers has been compromised, or the Agreement was terminated by Customer\u2019s failure to use reasonable security precautions, Business Associate may: (i) provide Customer with restricted access via a dedicated or private link or tunnel to Customer account or (ii) refuse to allow Customer to have access to Customer\u2019s account but will use reasonable efforts to copy Customer data on to media Customer provides to Business Associate, and will ship the media to Customer at Customer expense. Business Associate\u2019s efforts to copy Customer data onto Customer media shall be billable as an Additional Service at Business Associate\u2019s then current hourly rates. No Agency Relationship. As set forth in the Agreement, nothing in this BAA is intended to make either party an agent of the other. Nothing in this BAA is intended to confer upon Customer the right or authority to control Business Associate\u2019s conduct in the course of Business Associate complying with the Agreement and BAA. Nondisclosure. Customer agrees that the terms of this BAA are not publicly known and constitute Business Associate Confidential Information under the Agreement. Entire Agreement; Conflict. Except as amended by this BAA, the Agreement will remain in full force and effect. This BAA, together with the Agreement as amended by this BAA: (a) is intended by the parties as a final, complete and exclusive expression of the terms of their agreement; and (b) supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether oral or written) between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. If there is a conflict between the Agreement, this BAA or any other amendment or BAA to the Agreement or this BAA, the document later in time will prevail. Miscellaneous. Amendment. Customer and Business Associate agrees to take such action as is reasonably necessary to amend this HIPAA BAA from time to time as is necessary for either party to comply with the requirements of the Privacy Rule and related laws and regulations. Survival. Customer and Business Associate\u2019s respective rights and obligations under this HIPAA BAA shall survive the termination of the Agreement. Interpretation. Any ambiguity in the PaaS Agreement shall be resolved to permit Customer to comply with HIPAA and the Privacy Rule.

The risk management process is intended to support and protect the organization and its ability to fulfill its mission. Applicable Standards from the HITRUST Common Security Framework 03.a - Risk Management Program Development 03.b - Performing Risk Assessments 03.c - Risk Mitigation Applicable Standards from the HIPAA Security Rule 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A) \u2013 HIPAA Security Rule Risk Analysis 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B) \u2013 HIPAA Security Rule Risk Management 164.308(a)(8) \u2013 HIPAA Security Rule Evaluation Risk Management Policies It is the policy of Ovation to conduct thorough and timely risk assessments of the potential threats and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information (ePHI) (and other confidential and proprietary electronic information) it stores, transmits, and/or processes for its Customers and to develop strategies to efficiently and effectively mitigate the risks identified in the assessment process as an integral part of the Ovation's information security program. Risk analysis and risk management are recognized as important components of Ovation\u2019s corporate compliance program and information security program in accordance with the Risk Analysis and Risk Management implementation specifications within the Security Management standard and the evaluation standards set forth in the HIPAA Security Rule, 45 CFR 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A), 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B), 164.308(a)(1)(i), and 164.308(a)(8). Risk assessments are done throughout product life cycles: Before the integration of new system technologies and before changes are made to Ovation physical safeguards; and These changes do not include routine updates to existing systems, deployments of new systems created based on previously configured systems, deployments of new Customers, or new code developed for operations and management of the Ovation Platform. While making changes to Ovation physical equipment and facilities that introduce new, untested configurations. Ovation performs periodic technical and non-technical assessments of the security rule requirements as well as in response to environmental or operational changes affecting the security of ePHI. Ovation implements security measures sufficient to reduce risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level to: Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all ePHI Ovation receives, maintains, processes, and/or transmits for its Customers; Protect against any reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of Customer ePHI; Protect against any reasonably anticipated uses or disclosures of Customer ePHI that are not permitted or required; and Ensure compliance by all workforce members. Any risk remaining (residual) after other risk controls have been applied, requires sign off by the senior management and Ovation\u2019s Security Officer. All Ovation workforce members are expected to fully cooperate with all persons charged with doing risk management work, including contractors and audit personnel. Any workforce member that violates this policy will be subject to disciplinary action based on the severity of the violation according to Ovation\u2019s policies, which is outlined in the Ovation Policy Management Policy. The implementation, execution, and maintenance of the information security risk analysis and risk management process is the responsibility of Ovation\u2019s Security Officer (or other designated employee), and the identified Risk Management Team. All risk management efforts, including decisions made on what controls to put in place as well as those to not put into place, are documented and the documentation is maintained for six years. Risk Management Procedures Risk Assessment : The intent of completing a risk assessment is to determine potential threats and vulnerabilities and the likelihood and impact should they occur. The output of this process helps to identify appropriate controls for reducing or eliminating risk. Step 1. System Characterization The first step in assessing risk is to define the scope of the effort. To do this, identify where ePHI is received, maintained, processed, or transmitted. Using information-gathering techniques, the Ovation Platform boundaries are identified. Output \u2013 Characterization of the Ovation Platform system assessed, a good picture of the Platform environment, and delineation of Platform boundaries. Step 2. Threat Identification Potential threats (the potential for threat-sources to successfully exercise a particular vulnerability) are identified and documented. All potential threat-sources through the review of historical incidents and data from intelligence agencies, the government, etc., to help generate a list of potential threats. Output \u2013 A threat list containing a list of threat-sources that could exploit Platform vulnerabilities. Step 3. Vulnerability Identification Develop a list of technical and non-technical Platform vulnerabilities that could be exploited or triggered by potential threat-sources. Vulnerabilities can range from incomplete or conflicting policies that govern an organization\u2019s computer usage to insufficient safeguards to protect facilities that house computer equipment to any number of software, hardware, or other deficiencies that comprise an organization\u2019s computer network. Output \u2013 A list of the Platform vulnerabilities (observations) that could be exercised by potential threat-sources. Step 4. Control Analysis Document and assess the effectiveness of technical and non-technical controls that have been or will be implemented by Ovation to minimize or eliminate the likelihood / probability of a threat-source exploiting a Platform vulnerability. Output \u2013 List of current or planned controls (policies, procedures, training, technical mechanisms, insurance, etc.) used for the Platform to mitigate the likelihood of a vulnerability being exercised and reduce the impact of such an adverse event. Step 5. Likelihood Determination Determine the overall likelihood rating that indicates the probability that a vulnerability could be exploited by a threat-source given the existing or planned security controls. Output \u2013 Likelihood rating of low (.1), medium (.5), or high (1). Refer to the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high. Step 6. Impact Analysis Determine the level of adverse impact that would result from a threat successfully exploiting a vulnerability. Factors of the data and systems to consider should include the importance to Ovation's mission; sensitivity and criticality (value or importance); costs associated; loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and data. Output \u2013 Magnitude of impact rating of low (10), medium (50), or high (100). Refer to the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high. Step 7. Risk Determination Establish a risk level. By multiplying the ratings from the likelihood determination and impact analysis, a risk level is determined. This represents the degree or level of risk to which an IT system, facility, or procedure might be exposed if a given vulnerability were exercised. The risk rating also presents actions that senior management must take for each risk level. Output \u2013 Risk level of low (1-10), medium (>10-50) or high (>50-100). Refer to the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high. Step 8. Control Recommendations Identify controls that could reduce or eliminate the identified risks, as appropriate to the organization\u2019s operations to an acceptable level. Factors to consider when developing controls may include effectiveness of recommended options (i.e., system compatibility), legislation and regulation, organizational policy, operational impact, and safety and reliability. Control recommendations provide input to the risk mitigation process, during which the recommended procedural and technical security controls are evaluated, prioritized, and implemented. Output \u2013 Recommendation of control(s) and alternative solutions to mitigate risk. Step 9. Results Documentation Results of the risk assessment are documented in an official report, spreadsheet, or briefing and provided to senior management to make decisions on policy, procedure, budget, and Platform operational and management changes. Output \u2013 A risk assessment report that describes the threats and vulnerabilities, measures the risk, and provides recommendations for control implementation. Risk Mitigation : Risk mitigation involves prioritizing, evaluating, and implementing the appropriate risk-reducing controls recommended from the Risk Assessment process to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Ovation Platform ePHI. Determination of appropriate controls to reduce risk is dependent upon the risk tolerance of the organization consistent with its goals and mission. Step 1. Prioritize Actions Using results from Step 7 of the Risk Assessment, sort the threat and vulnerability pairs according to their risk-levels in descending order. This establishes a prioritized list of actions needing to be taken, with the pairs at the top of the list getting/requiring the most immediate attention and top priority in allocating resources Output \u2013 Actions ranked from high to low Step 2. Evaluate Recommended Control Options Although possible controls for each threat and vulnerability pair are arrived at in Step 8 of the Risk Assessment, review the recommended control(s) and alternative solutions for reasonableness and appropriateness. The feasibility (e.g., compatibility, user acceptance, etc.) and effectiveness (e.g., degree of protection and level of risk mitigation) of the recommended controls should be analyzed. In the end, select a \u201cmost appropriate\u201d control option for each threat and vulnerability pair. Output \u2013 list of feasible controls Step 3. Conduct Cost-Benefit Analysis Determine the extent to which a control is cost-effective. Compare the benefit (e.g., risk reduction) of applying a control with its subsequent cost of application. Controls that are not cost-effective are also identified during this step. Analyzing each control or set of controls in this manner, and prioritizing across all controls being considered, can greatly aid in the decision-making process. Output \u2013 Documented cost-benefit analysis of either implementing or not implementing each specific control Step 4. Select Control(s) Taking into account the information and results from previous steps, Ovation\u2019s mission, and other important criteria, the Risk Management Team determines the best control(s) for reducing risks to the information systems and to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI. These controls may consist of a mix of administrative, physical, and/or technical safeguards. Output \u2013 Selected control(s) Step 5. Assign Responsibility Identify the workforce members with the skills necessary to implement each of the specific controls outlined in the previous step, and assign their responsibilities. Also identify the equipment, training and other resources needed for the successful implementation of controls. Resources may include time, money, equipment, etc. Output \u2013 List of resources, responsible persons and their assignments Step 6. Develop Safeguard Implementation Plan Develop an overall implementation or action plan and individual project plans needed to implement the safeguards and controls identified. The Implementation Plan should contain the following information: Each risk or vulnerability/threat pair and risk level; Prioritized actions; The recommended feasible control(s) for each identified risk; Required resources for implementation of selected controls; Team member responsible for implementation of each control; Start date for implementation Target date for completion of implementation; Maintenance requirements. The overall implementation plan provides a broad overview of the safeguard implementation, identifying important milestones and timeframes, resource requirements (staff and other individuals\u2019 time, budget, etc.), interrelationships between projects, and any other relevant information. Regular status reporting of the plan, along with key metrics and success indicators should be reported to Ovation Senior Management. Individual project plans for safeguard implementation may be developed and contain detailed steps that resources assigned carry out to meet implementation timeframes and expectations. Additionally, consider including items in individual project plans such as a project scope, a list deliverables, key assumptions, objectives, task completion dates and project requirements. Output \u2013 Safeguard Implementation Plan Step 7. Implement Selected Controls As controls are implemented, monitor the affected system(s) to verify that the implemented controls continue to meet expectations. Elimination of all risk is not practical. Depending on individual situations, implemented controls may lower a risk level but not completely eliminate the risk. Continually and consistently communicate expectations to all Risk Management Team members, as well as senior management and other key people throughout the risk mitigation process. Identify when new risks are identified and when controls lower or offset risk rather than eliminate it. Additional monitoring is especially crucial during times of major environmental changes, organizational or process changes, or major facilities changes. If risk reduction expectations are not met, then repeat all or a part of the risk management process so that additional controls needed to lower risk to an acceptable level can be identified. Output \u2013 Residual Risk documentation Risk Management Schedule : The two principle components of the risk management process - risk assessment and risk mitigation - will be carried out according to the following schedule to ensure the continued adequacy and continuous improvement of Ovation\u2019s information security program: Scheduled Basis \u2013 an overall risk assessment of Ovation\u2019s information system infrastructure will be conducted annually. The assessment process should be completed in a timely fashion so that risk mitigation strategies can be determined and included in the corporate budgeting process. Throughout a System\u2019s Development Life Cycle \u2013 from the time that a need for a new, untested information system configuration and/or application is identified through the time it is disposed of, ongoing assessments of the potential threats to a system and its vulnerabilities should be undertaken as a part of the maintenance of the system. As Needed \u2013 the Security Officer (or other designated employee) or Risk Management Team may call for a full or partial risk assessment in response to changes in business strategies, information technology, information sensitivity, threats, legal liabilities, or other significant factors that affect Ovation\u2019s Platform. Process Documentation Maintain documentation of all risk assessment, risk management, and risk mitigation efforts for a minimum of six years.","title":"Risk Management Policy"},{"location":"policies/risk_management_policy/#risk-management-policy","text":"This policy establishes the scope, objectives, and procedures of Ovation's information security risk management process.

The Implementation Plan should contain the following information: Each risk or vulnerability/threat pair and risk level; Prioritized actions; The recommended feasible control(s) for each identified risk; Required resources for implementation of selected controls; Team member responsible for implementation of each control; Start date for implementation Target date for completion of implementation; Maintenance requirements. The overall implementation plan provides a broad overview of the safeguard implementation, identifying important milestones and timeframes, resource requirements (staff and other individuals\u2019 time, budget, etc.), interrelationships between projects, and any other relevant information. Regular status reporting of the plan, along with key metrics and success indicators should be reported to Ovation Senior Management. Individual project plans for safeguard implementation may be developed and contain detailed steps that resources assigned carry out to meet implementation timeframes and expectations. Additionally, consider including items in individual project plans such as a project scope, a list deliverables, key assumptions, objectives, task completion dates and project requirements. Output \u2013 Safeguard Implementation Plan Step 7. Implement Selected Controls As controls are implemented, monitor the affected system(s) to verify that the implemented controls continue to meet expectations. Elimination of all risk is not practical. Depending on individual situations, implemented controls may lower a risk level but not completely eliminate the risk. Continually and consistently communicate expectations to all Risk Management Team members, as well as senior management and other key people throughout the risk mitigation process. Identify when new risks are identified and when controls lower or offset risk rather than eliminate it. Additional monitoring is especially crucial during times of major environmental changes, organizational or process changes, or major facilities changes. If risk reduction expectations are not met, then repeat all or a part of the risk management process so that additional controls needed to lower risk to an acceptable level can be identified. Output \u2013 Residual Risk documentation Risk Management Schedule : The two principle components of the risk management process - risk assessment and risk mitigation - will be carried out according to the following schedule to ensure the continued adequacy and continuous improvement of Ovation\u2019s information security program: Scheduled Basis \u2013 an overall risk assessment of Ovation\u2019s information system infrastructure will be conducted annually. The assessment process should be completed in a timely fashion so that risk mitigation strategies can be determined and included in the corporate budgeting process. Throughout a System\u2019s Development Life Cycle \u2013 from the time that a need for a new, untested information system configuration and/or application is identified through the time it is disposed of, ongoing assessments of the potential threats to a system and its vulnerabilities should be undertaken as a part of the maintenance of the system. As Needed \u2013 the Security Officer (or other designated employee) or Risk Management Team may call for a full or partial risk assessment in response to changes in business strategies, information technology, information sensitivity, threats, legal liabilities, or other significant factors that affect Ovation\u2019s Platform.","title":"Risk Management Procedures"},{"location":"policies/risk_management_policy/#process-documentation","text":"Maintain documentation of all risk assessment, risk management, and risk mitigation efforts for a minimum of six years.","title":"Process Documentation"},{"location":"policies/roles_policy/","text":"Roles Policy Ovation has a Security Officer [164.308(a)(2)] and Privacy Officer [164.308(a)(2)] appointed to assist in maintaining and enforcing safeguards towards compliance.

Access is not granted until receipt, review, and approval by the Ovation Security Officer; The request for access is retained for future reference. All access to Ovation systems and services are reviewed and updated on an bi-annual basis to assure proper authorizations are in place commiserate with job functions. Any Ovation workforce member can request change of access by emailing the Security Officer. Access to systems is controlled using centralized user management and authentication. When possible, all authentication requests utilize two factor authentication using mobile devices as the second factor. Temporary accounts are not used unless absolutely necessary for business purposes. Accounts are reviewed every 90 days to assure temporary accounts are not left unnecessarily. Accounts that are inactive for over 90 days are removed. In the case of non-personal information, such as generic educational content, identification and authentication may not be required. This is the responsibility of Ovation Customers to define, and not Ovation. Privileged users must first access systems using standard, unique user accounts before switching to privileged users and performing privileged tasks. All application-to-application communication using service accounts is restricted and not permitted unless absolutely needed. Automated tools are used to limit account access across applications and systems. Generic accounts are not allowed on Ovation systems. In cases of increased risk or known attempted unauthorized access, immediate steps are taken by the Security and Privacy Officer to limit access and reduce risk of unauthorized access. Direct system-to-system, system-to-application, and application-to-application authentication and authorization are limited and controlled to restrict access. Workforce Clearance Procedures The level of security assigned to a user to the organization\u2019s information systems is based on the minimum necessary amount of data access required to carry out legitimate job responsibilities assigned to a user\u2019s job classification and/or to a user needing access to carry out treatment, payment, or healthcare operations. All access requests are treated on a \u2018least-access principle\u201d. Ovation maintains a minimum necessary approach to access to Customer data. As such, Ovation.io, Inc., including all workforce members, does not readily have access to any ePHI. Access Authorization Role based access categories for each Ovation system and application are pre-approved by the Security Officer or Chief Architect. Ovation utilizes hardware and software firewalls to segment data, prevent unauthorized access, and monitor traffic for denial of service attacks. Person or Entity Authentication Each workforce member has and uses a unique user ID and password that identifies him/her as the user of the information system. Each Customer and Partner has and uses a unique user ID and password that identifies him/her as the user of the information system. Unique User Identification Access to the Ovation Platform systems and applications is controlled by requiring unique User Login ID\u2019s and passwords for each individual user and developer. Passwords requirements mandate strong password controls (see below). Passwords are not displayed at any time and are not transmitted or stored in plain text. Default accounts on all production systems, including root, are disabled. Shared accounts are not allowed within Ovation systems or networks. Automatic Logoff Users are required to make information systems inaccessible by any other individual when unattended by the users (ex. by using a password protected screen saver or logging off the system). Information systems automatically log users off the systems after 10 minutes of inactivity. The Security Officer pre-approves exceptions to automatic log off requirements. Employee Workstation Use All workstations at Ovation are company owned, and all are laptop Apple products running Mac operating system. Workstations may not be used to engage in any activity that is illegal or is in violation of organization\u2019s policies. Access may not be used for transmitting, retrieving, or storage of any communications of a discriminatory or harassing nature or materials that are obscene or \u201cX-rated\u201d. Harassment of any kind is prohibited. No messages with derogatory or inflammatory remarks about an individual\u2019s race, age, disability, religion, national origin, physical attributes, sexual preference, or health condition shall be transmitted or maintained. No abusive, hostile, profane, or offensive language is to be transmitted through organization\u2019s system. Information systems/applications also may not be used for any other purpose that is illegal, unethical, or against company policies or contrary to organization\u2019s best interests. Messages containing information related to a lawsuit or investigation may not be sent without prior approval. Solicitation of non-company business, or any use of organization\u2019s information systems/applications for personal gain is prohibited. Transmitted messages may not contain material that criticizes organization, its providers, its employees, or others. Users may not misrepresent, obscure, suppress, or replace another user\u2019s identity in transmitted or stored messages. Workstation hard drives will be encrypted using FileVault 2.0. All workstations have firewalls enabled to prevent unauthorized access unless explicitly granted. All workstations are to have the following messages added to the lock screen and login screen: This computer is owned by Ovation.io, Inc.. By logging in, unlocking, and/or using this computer you acknowledge you have seen, and follow, these policies (https://policy.ovation.io/) and have completed this training (https://training.ovation.io/). Please contact us if you have problems with this - privacy@ovation.io. Wireless Access Use Ovation production systems are not accessible directly over wireless channels. Wireless access disabled on all production systems. When access production systems via remote wireless connections, the same system access policies and procedures apply to wireless as all other connections, including wired. Wireless networks managed within Ovation non-production facilities (offices, etc) are secured with the following configurations: All data in transit over wireless is encrypted using WPA2 encryption; SSIDs are not broadcast; Employee Termination Procedures The Human Resources Department (or other designated department), users, and their supervisors are required to notify the Security Officer upon completion and/or termination of access needs and facilitating completion of the \u201cTermination Checklist\". The Human Resources Department, users, and supervisors are required to notify the IS Help Desk to terminate a user\u2019s access rights if there is evidence or reason to believe the following (these incidents are also reported on an incident report and is filed with the Privacy Officer): The user has been using their access rights inappropriately; A user\u2019s password has been compromised (a new password may be provided to the user if the user is not identified as the individual compromising the original password); An unauthorized individual is utilizing a user\u2019s User Login ID and password (a new password may be provided to the user if the user is not identified as providing the unauthorized individual with the User Login ID and password). The Security Officer will terminate users\u2019 access rights immediately upon notification. The Security Officer audits and may terminate access of users that have not logged into organization\u2019s information systems/applications for an extended period of time. Paper Records Ovation does not use paper records for any sensitive information. Use of paper for recording and storing sensitive data is against Ovation policies. Password Management User IDs and passwords are used to control access to Ovation systems and may not be disclosed to anyone for any reason. Users may not allow anyone, for any reason, to have access to any information system using another user\u2019s unique user ID and password. On all production systems and application in the Ovation environment, password configurations are set to require that passwords are a minimum of 8 character length, 90 day password expiration, account lockout after 5 invalid attempts, and account lockout after 15 minutes of inactivity. All system and application passwords are hashed by concatenating the user's password and a random 256-bit salt value, generated on a per-user basis, and then applying SHA-256 to the value to create a password hash. The password hash and the salt are then stored in the backend database and are used for password validation on future user authentication attempts.* Each information system automatically requires users to change passwords at a pre-determined interval as determined by the organization, based on the criticality and sensitivity of the ePHI contained within the network, system, application, and/or database. Passwords are inactivated immediately upon an employee\u2019s termination (refer to the termination procedures in this policy). All default system, application, and Partner passwords are changed before deployment to production. All passwords used in configuration scripts are secured and encrypted.
