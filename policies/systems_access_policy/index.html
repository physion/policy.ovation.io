<li>The user has been using their access rights inappropriately;</li>
<li>A user’s password has been compromised (a new password may be provided to the user if the user is not identified as the individual compromising the original password);</li>
<li>An unauthorized individual is utilizing a user’s User Login ID and password (a new password may be provided to the user if the user is not identified as providing the unauthorized individual with the User Login ID and password).</li>

<p>Ovation does not use paper records for any sensitive information. Use of paper for recording and storing sensitive data is against Ovation policies.</p>
<h2 id="password-management">Password Management</h2>
<ul>
<li>User IDs and passwords are used to control access to Ovation systems and may not be disclosed to anyone for any reason.</li>
<li>Users may not allow anyone, for any reason, to have access to any information system using another user’s unique user ID and password.</li>
<li>On all production systems and application in the Ovation environment, password configurations are set to require that passwords are a minimum of 8 character length, 90 day password expiration, account lockout after 5 invalid attempts, and account lockout after 15 minutes of inactivity.</li>
<li>All system and application passwords are hashed by concatenating the user's password and a random 256-bit salt value, generated on a per-user basis, and then applying SHA-256 to the value to create a password hash. The password hash and the salt are then stored in the backend database and are used for password validation on future user authentication attempts.* Each information system automatically requires users to change passwords at a pre-determined interval as determined by the organization, based on the criticality and sensitivity of the ePHI contained within the network, system, application, and/or database.</li>
<li>Passwords are inactivated immediately upon an employee’s termination (refer to the termination procedures in this policy).</li>
<li>All default system, application, and Partner passwords are changed before deployment to production.</li>
<li>All passwords used in configuration scripts are secured and encrypted.</li>
<li>If a user believes their user ID has been compromised, they are required to immediately report the incident to the Security Office.</li>
