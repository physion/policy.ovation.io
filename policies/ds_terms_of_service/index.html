<p>Last updated: April 15, 2019</p>
<h2 id="1-terms-of-service">1. TERMS OF SERVICE.</h2>
<p><strong>Acceptance.</strong>  Ovation.io, Inc.

Your access to the Site and Platform and all other use of the Service is subject to acceptance without modification of all of the terms and conditions contained herein (<strong><em>Terms of Service</em></strong>).  The Terms of Service shall also be deemed to include all other operating rules, conditions, policies and procedures that are referred to below or that may otherwise be published or implemented by Ovation, from time to time, within the Platform (collectively, <strong><em>Policies</em></strong>), including without limitation, the <a href="../privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p><strong>IF YOU ARE ACCESSING THE PLATFORM AND USING THE SERVICE ON BEHALF OF, FOR THE BENEFIT OF OR UNDER AN ACCOUNT ESTABLISHED BY ANY CUSTOMER, THEN YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT:  YOU ARE ALSO BOUND BY ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT ARE APPLICABLE TO THAT CUSTOMER (WHETHER SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS OF SERVICE OR IN ANY CONTRACT BETWEEN THAT CUSTOMER AND OVATION); AND THAT IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO IDENTIFY, UNDERSTAND AND COMPLY WITH ALL SUCH OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS.</strong></p>
<p><strong>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, OR IF YOU ARE NOT ELIGIBLE OR AUTHORIZED TO AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, THEN DO NOT REGISTER FOR, DOWNLOAD, ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE.  DOWNLOADING ANY APP, COMPLETING OUR REGISTRATION PROCESS OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING OR USING THE PLATFORM OR ANY OTHER PART OF THE SERVICE WILL CONSTITUTE ACCEPTANCE OF, AND CREATE A LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE CONTRACT UNDER WHICH YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY, ALL OF THE TERMS OF SERVICE, WITHOUT MODIFICATION.</strong></p>
<p><em>Updates.</em>  Ovation reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to update, modify or replace the Terms of Service (including any Policy), in whole or in part, at any time.  Ovation will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any material change in advance of the effective date of any change.  Change notices may be communicated by postings via the Platform, email or otherwise.  In any case, you should periodically check the Policies and other Terms of Service for changes.  Continued access or use of the Service following any change to the Terms of Service constitutes your acceptance of those changes.  The Terms of Service may not otherwise be amended, as they apply to you, except by a written agreement executed by you and Ovation. Ovation may modify, suspend or terminate the Service (including without limitation, access to the Platform), in whole or in part, at any time.  </p>
<p><strong>Eligibility.</strong>  The Service is intended by Ovation to be made available only to Users who are at least 18 years old or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, whichever age is older.  If you do not qualify, then you are prohibited from accessing, registering for, uploading, downloading or using any aspect of the Service.  Ovation will not collect personally identifiable information from any person who is actually known to us to be under the age of 13.  If we become aware that a person under 13 has provided personally identifiable information, Ovation will take steps to remove such information and terminate that individual’s account, access and use of the Service.  Ovation may refuse to offer or continue offering the Service to any person or entity, and may change its eligibility criteria from time to time.</p>
<h2 id="2-definitions">2. DEFINITIONS</h2>
<p><strong><em>Analytics</em></strong>  means statistics, metrics, abstractions, rules, models, collections, combinations and other analyses that are based on or derived from the Service or Service Data (including without limitation, measurements of Service usage and performance), which are developed in a manner that does not disclose the identity of a Source or any individual identified in the Service Data and that does not disclose any Service Data except in a de-identified (in accordance with 45 CFR §164.514(a)-(c)) or aggregated form (combined with other data, results or measurements). </p>
<p><strong><em>Contract</em></strong>  means the sales quotation, proposal, order form, sales confirmation or other similar writing provided by Ovation or its authorized distributor (as the case may be) that describes the Service, term and prices being offered to Customer, whichever is most current (or the corresponding invoice, if no such other writing exists).</p>
<p><strong>Customer</strong>  means any company, laboratory, or other organization or entity that has entered into an agreement with Ovation to establish an account to use and pay for the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Data</strong> means any data that Customer generates on its own, such as search queries, and sends to Ovation pursuant to its access and use of the Service. </p>
<p><strong>Deliverable</strong>  means any work product that is delivered to Customer, and which results from Work performed by Ovation.</p>

<p><strong>Ovation IP</strong>  means the Site, Platform, Service, Service Data, Deliverables, Ovation Confidential Information, access credentials and all other Service-related documentation, data, know-how and information provided by Ovation.</p>
<p><strong>Source</strong> means any laboratory, company, or other organization or entity that grants or has granted to Ovation a license to use its data in de-identified and aggregated form.</p>
<p><strong>Platform</strong>  means the technology platform developed and/or used by Ovation in providing the Service (including all related ideas, concepts, inventions, systems, hardware, software, interfaces, dashboards, tools, utilities, content, templates, forms, samples, techniques, methods, processes, algorithms, know-how, trade secrets and other technologies, implementations and information), and all corrections, improvements and extensions thereto.</p>
<p><strong>Service</strong>  means Ovation’s application that provides Customer with access to and use of the Service Data (defined below) for commercial use through Ovation’s  provision of its real-time search, dashboards and downloads features, and which is made available under these Terms of Service, as such application may be hosted in a cloud environment, branded and provided on a software-as-a-service basis from time to time by Ovation.</p>
<p><strong>Service Data</strong> means all data and data sets (other than Customer Data) that Ovation makes available to Customer pursuant to providing access to and use of the Service and as specified under these Terms of Service.</p>
<p><strong>Statement of Work</strong>  means any written work statement that references these Terms of Service and that is acceptable to and executed by Customer and Ovation, and which will include other information related to the Work (such as, for example, professional services descriptions, schedules and payments).</p>
<p><strong>User</strong>  means each of the named individuals who is specifically identified by Customer for onboarding and use of the Service under Customer’s Account.</p>
<h2 id="3-service">3. SERVICE</h2>
<p><strong>License.</strong>  So long as the Service is provided to Customer and subject to compliance with all Terms of Service, Ovation will make the Service available to Customer and hereby grants to Customer a nonexclusive, non-transferable, revocable right and license:  to access and use the Service through a web-based interface; and to permit identified Users to do the same under its Account.  The Ovation IP, including, in particular, the Service Data, may be used only in unmodified form and solely for Customer's internal business purposes.  Customer's and Users' access and use of the Ovation IP, including, in particular, the Service Data, shall comply with all other conditions that may be set forth in these Terms of Service or the Contract (such as, for example, restrictions regarding the number or identity of authorized Users, data formats, size limits, time limits or prohibited uses).  From time to time, Customer and Users may (at their discretion) provide Feedback to Ovation. </p>
<p><strong>Account.</strong>  Ovation will provide Customer with access credentials (and/or a mechanism that permits Customer to specify access credentials) as needed to identify, authorize and designate roles for Users who will have rights (as appropriate to their roles) to establish, administer, configure, manage and use the Service through a Customer-specific account (<strong><em>Account</em></strong>).  Customer and Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of all Account information (including access credentials).  Customer agrees to be liable for all activities under its Account.  Customer and Users agree to keep all Account information up-to-date and to notify Ovation immediately of any unauthorized use of their Account.  Customer shall promptly notify Ovation of Users who are no longer permitted to access and use the Service under Customer's Account.  Customer shall implement and comply with reasonable policies and methods to confirm and verify the actual identity of Users that will be registered to access and use the Service under its Account.</p>
<p><strong>Resources.</strong>  Sources are solely responsible for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of Service Data that they provide, and for acquiring all consents, authorizations, permissions and other rights necessary for Ovation to receive, access, copy, store, process, distribute, transmit, display and use Service Data in de-identified and aggregated form pursuant to The Health Insurance Portability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations (<strong><em>HIPAA</em></strong>) and as provided in these Terms of Service. Customers are solely responsible for all servers, storage, software, databases, network and communications systems and services needed by Customer and Users to access, manage and use the Service and Service Data, and  backup, recovery, network security and maintenance services for Customer's and Users' internal systems (collectively, the <strong><em>Customer Resources</em></strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Service Data.</strong>  Ovation does not review the substance of Service Data and does not control the use of Service Data that has been provided to Ovation.  Authentication of the true identity of Internet users is difficult, and so Ovation cannot and does not confirm that any user in the provenance of Service Data is the person or entity who they claim to be.  Accordingly, Ovation makes no representation or warranty, and assumes no liability, regarding the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability or appropriateness of any such Service Data.  Customer and its Users agree to assume all risk and liability arising from (a) sharing their own, if any, results derived from use of the Service Data (including any further distribution or use for an unintended purpose) and (b) using Service Data (including any and all results that are generated using such Service Data).</p>
<p><strong>Support Services.</strong>  Using commercially reasonable efforts, Ovation will:  assist Customer to access, configure, verify and commence User operation of the Service under its Account; provide ongoing technical support for the Service (telephone, email or web-based), in accordance with its standard practices during normal business hours; and endeavor to analyze and resolve material errors.  Ovation has no obligation to operate or support any version of the Service other than the then current version.  Ovation may charge Customer in accordance with its then current policies for support services that result from problems, errors or inquiries related to the Customer Resources.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Services.</strong>  From time to time, Customer may request and Ovation may agree to provide certain additional implementation, integration, data analysis, development, training or other professional services related to the Service (<strong><em>Work</em></strong>).  Ovation agrees to undertake and use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the Work as described in the corresponding Statement of Work.  Ovation grants Customer a nonexclusive, nontransferable right and license (without right to sublicense) to use the resulting Deliverables solely in conjunction with authorized use of the Service, subject to the terms of these Terms of Service and other rights or restrictions set forth in the Statement of Work.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Services.</strong>  Certain applications, platforms and services provided by third parties (collectively, <strong><em>Third Party Services</em></strong>) may be accessed from the Service.  Third Party Services are not operated or controlled by Ovation, and Ovation shall not be responsible for the availability, accuracy or any other aspect of the content or function of Third Party Services.  Additional or different terms and conditions (including without limitation, privacy and security practices) apply to the use of Third Party Services, and Customer and each User hereby agrees to comply with such terms and conditions when using Third Party Services.</p>
<h2 id="4-payments">4. PAYMENTS</h2>
<p><strong>Fees.</strong>  Customer shall pay Ovation the fees described in the Contract and each Statement of Work, in the amounts and at the times set forth therein, and as otherwise stated in these Terms of Service.  Fees may be specified as being payable in advance or in arrears; fees may be fixed, contingent or variable (e.g., depending on usage factors or per sample charges); and fees may be specified on a recurring basis (e.g., subscription fees and/or usage fees, which may be payable monthly, quarterly or annually) or non-recurring basis (e.g., one-time activation fees).</p>
<p><strong>Recurring Fees.</strong>  Recurring fees (e.g., subscription fees and/or usage fees) must be paid by an automatic payment method (credit card or ACH bank transfer) which may be stored.  Generally, recurring fees will be automatically charged on such stored payment method 15 days following invoicing.  Customer will receive an invoice (by email) of all recurring fees (whether from Ovation or from a partner of Ovation) for current billing period.  By choosing a plan with recurring fees, Customer acknowledges that such recurring fees have an initial and recurring payment feature and Customer accepts responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. OVATION MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM CUSTOMER, UNTIL CUSTOMER PROVIDES PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH WILL BE CONFIRMED IN WRITING BY OVATION) THAT CUSTOMER HAS TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISHES TO CHANGE CUSTOMER’S PAYMENT METHOD. SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE OVATION REASONABLY COULD ACT. CUSTOMER MAY TERMINATE ITS AUTHORIZATION OR CHANGE ITS PAYMENT METHOD, BY VISITING CUSTOMER’S ACCOUNT SETTINGS ON THE SITE. Customer hereby accepts all credit card or ACH payment charges that comply with these Terms of Service.</p>
<p><strong>Payment Terms.</strong>  Ovation may collect payments from Customer directly or use a third-party payment processor (<strong><em>Payment Processor</em></strong>) to bill Customer through a payment account linked to Customer’s Account for use of the Service.  The processing of payments by a Payment Processor will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of such Payment Processor in addition to these Terms of Service and the Contract or applicable Statement of Work. Ovation shall not be responsible for error by the Payment Processor. Unless specified otherwise, all amounts due hereunder shall be paid in full (without deduction, set-off or counterclaim) within 15 days after invoice in US dollars at Ovation's address or to an account specified by Ovation.  Past due amounts shall bear a late payment charge, until paid, at the rate of 1.0% per month or the maximum amount permitted by law, whichever is less.  If any payment is past due, Ovation shall have the right to take whatever action it deems appropriate (including without limitation, disabling the Account, suspending User access to the Service, or terminating the Contract pursuant to Section 10).  Without limiting the foregoing, if Ovation, through the Payment Processor, does not receive payment from Customer, Customer agrees to pay all amounts due on its Account upon demand. Customer agrees to reimburse Ovation for all costs (including attorneys' fees) incurred in collecting late payments.</p>
<p><strong>Taxes.</strong>  All payments required by these Terms of Service are exclusive of federal, state, local and foreign taxes, duties, tariffs, levies, withholdings and similar assessments (including without limitation, sales taxes, use taxes and value added taxes), and Customer agrees to bear and be responsible for the payment of all such charges, excluding taxes based upon Ovation’s net income.  All amounts due hereunder shall be grossed-up for any withholding taxes imposed by any foreign government.  If Customer claims exemption from any tax, then it shall furnish Ovation with a valid tax exemption certificate issued by or acceptable to the applicable taxing jurisdiction or entity.</p>
<p><strong>Current Billing Information Required.</strong>  CUSTOMER MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE BILLING INFORMATION FOR ITS ACCOUNT. CUSTOMER MUST PROMPTLY UPDATE ALL RELEVANT INFORMATION TO KEEP ITS ACCOUNT CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING ADDRESS, CREDIT CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE), AND CUSTOMER MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY OVATION OR THE PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF CUSTOMER’S PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF CUSTOMER BECOMES AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF A USER NAME OR PASSWORD. CHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE MADE AT CUSTOMER’S ACCOUNT SETTINGS ON THE SITE.  IF CUSTOMER FAILS TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, CUSTOMER AGREES THAT OVATION MAY CONTINUE CHARGING CUSTOMER FOR ANY RECURRING FEES UNDER CUSTOMER’S BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS CUSTOMER HAS TERMINATED OR CANCELED ITS USE OF THE SERVICE.</p>
<h2 id="5-confidentiality">5. CONFIDENTIALITY</h2>
<p><strong>Scope.</strong>  The term <strong><em>Confidential Information</em></strong> means all trade secrets, know-how, inventions, software and other financial, business, scientific, clinical or technical information and data disclosed by or for a party in connection with using or providing the Service.  The restrictions on use and disclosure of Confidential Information will not apply to any information or data that the receiving party can demonstrate is (a) rightfully furnished to it without restriction by a third party, (b) generally available to the public without breach of these Terms of Service or (c) independently developed by it without reliance on such information or data.  For clarity, all Service Data, Feedback, Ovation IP and pricing information will be treated as Ovation’s Confidential Information.</p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality.</strong>  Except for the specific rights granted by these Terms of Service, and except for disclosures that are necessary to comply with any legal, regulatory, law enforcement or similar requirement or investigation, the receiving party shall not access, reproduce, use or disclose any of the other party's Confidential Information without its written consent, and shall use reasonable care to protect the other's Confidential Information from unauthorized access, use and disclosure (including by ensuring that its personnel who access any Confidential Information have a need to know for the permitted purpose and are bound by written obligations that are at least as protective as these Terms of Service).  Each party shall be responsible for any breach of confidentiality by its personnel (including Users, in the case of Customer).  Promptly after any termination (or at the disclosing party's request at any other time), the receiving party shall return all of the other's tangible Confidential Information, permanently erase all Confidential Information from any storage media and destroy all information, records and materials developed therefrom (except Confidential Information stored in accordance with automated backup procedures in the ordinary course of business).  Each party may disclose only the general nature, but not the specific terms, of any Contract without the prior consent of the other party; <em>provided</em>, Customer or Ovation may provide a copy of the Contract or otherwise disclose its terms in connection with any legal or regulatory requirement, audit, financing transaction or due diligence inquiry.</p>
<p><strong>Compelled Disclosures.</strong>  These restrictions will not prevent either party from complying with any law, regulation, court order, demand by law enforcement or other legal requirement or investigation that purports to compel disclosure of any Service Data or other Confidential Information.  The receiving party will promptly notify the disclosing party upon learning of any such legal requirement, and cooperate with the disclosing party in the exercise of its right to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information before any tribunal or governmental agency.</p>

<p><strong>Customer and Users.</strong>  Customer and each User warrants to Ovation that the access, transfer, collection, processing, distribution and use of Service Data as described in these Terms of Service complies with and will not violate applicable laws, regulations, rules or proprietary rights (including without limitation, professional and scientific standards, copyrights and rights regarding privacy, publicity and defamation).</p>
<p><strong>Ovation.</strong>  Ovation warrants to Customer that all Work will be provided in a professional manner and that it will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the Service available to Users at all times, subject to downtimes for scheduled maintenance, upgrades, repairs, security issues and emergency outages.  Ovation will not be responsible for any delay, degradation or failure in the Service resulting from or attributable to (a) unusually high usage volumes, (b) failures in Customer Resources or any third party’s services, networks or systems, (c) Customer's or any User’s or third party's negligence, acts or omissions, (d) any force majeure or other cause beyond Ovation's reasonable control or (e) unauthorized access to the Service, breach of firewalls or other hacking.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimers.</strong>  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SPECIFIED HEREIN, THE WORK, SERVICE, SERVICE DATA AND OTHER OVATION IP ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE", WITHOUT REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.  FOR CLARITY, OVATION AND ITS LICENSORS DO NOT WARRANT THAT: (A) ANY INFORMATION WILL BE TIMELY, ACCURATE, RELIABLE OR CORRECT; (B) THE WORK, SERVICE, SERVICE DATA OR OTHER OVATION IP WILL BE ERROR-FREE, UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE OR AVAILABLE AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME OR PLACE; (C) ANY DEFECTS OR ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED; OR (D) THE WORK, SERVICE, SERVICE DATA OR OTHER OVATION IP WILL MEET CUSTOMER’S OR ANY USER'S REQUIREMENTS OR THAT ANY OUTCOME CAN BE ACHIEVED.  TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, OVATION HEREBY DISCLAIMS (FOR ITSELF AND ITS LICENSORS) ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN, WITH RESPECT TO THE WORK, SERVICE, SERVICE DATA AND OTHER OVATION IP, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, QUIET ENJOYMENT, ACCURACY, INTEGRATION, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND ALL WARRANTIES ARISING FROM ANY COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE.</p>
<h2 id="8-indemnification">8. INDEMNIFICATION</h2>
<p><strong>Customer.</strong>  Customer agrees to defend Ovation against any demand, suit, action or other claim by any third party (including any User under its Account) that is related to any use of the Service or Service Data provided by Customer or Users or any breach of Customer's or any User's obligations or warranties under these Terms of Service, and to indemnify Ovation for liabilities (as specified in settlements or judgment awards) that result from such claims.</p>
<p><strong>Ovation.</strong>  Ovation agrees to defend Customer and Users (<strong><em>Customer Indemnitees</em></strong>) against any demand, suit, action or other claim by any third party that the Service or any Deliverable misappropriates or infringes its intellectual property rights, and to indemnify Customer Indemnitees for liabilities (as specified in settlements or judgment awards) that result from such claims.  If the Service or any Deliverable becomes or, in Ovation's opinion, is likely to become the subject of an injunction or other claim preventing its use as contemplated herein, Ovation may, at its option and expense (a) obtain the rights needed to continue providing the Service or using the Deliverable, or (b) replace or modify the Service or Deliverable without substantially compromising its principal functions.  If (a) and (b) are not reasonably available, then Ovation may (c) upon written notice to Customer, terminate Customer's Account and stop providing the Service to Users, and refund to Customer any prepaid fees, pro-rated for the remainder of the prepaid period.  The foregoing states the entire liability of Ovation, and Customer's and each User's exclusive remedy, with respect to any actual or alleged violation of intellectual property or proprietary rights by the Ovation IP or Work, any part thereof or their use or operation.</p>
<p><strong>Exclusions.</strong>  Ovation shall have no liability or obligation hereunder with respect to any claim attributable to (a) any use of the Ovation IP by Customer or any User not strictly in accord with these Terms of Service, or in an application or environment or on a platform or with devices for which it was not designed or contemplated or (b) alterations, combinations or enhancements of the Ovation IP not created by Ovation.</p>
<p><strong>Conditions.</strong>  The indemnifying party's obligations hereunder are conditioned on (a) the party seeking indemnification providing prompt written notice thereof and reasonable cooperation, information, and assistance in connection therewith and (b) the indemnifying party having sole control and authority to defend, settle or compromise such claim.  The indemnified party may participate in the defense at its sole cost and expense.  The indemnifying party will not enter into any settlement (other than for payment of money subject to its indemnity) that adversely affects the indemnified party's rights or interests without its prior written approval, not to be unreasonably withheld.  The indemnifying party shall not be responsible for any settlement it does not approve in writing.</p>
<h2 id="9-limitation-of-liability">9.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
<p>EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS VOID, PROHIBITED OR UNENFORCEABLE BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR LIABILITIES TO THIRD PARTIES PURSUANT TO SECTION 8 (INDEMNIFICATION):  IN NO EVENT SHALL OVATION (OR ITS LICENSORS), CUSTOMER OR ANY USER BE LIABLE CONCERNING THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE CONTRACT OR THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ANY CLAIM OR ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE), FOR ANY (A) LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OR INTERRUPTION OF USE, OR COST TO PROCURE SUBSTITUTE TECHNOLOGIES, GOODS OR SERVICES OR (B) INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, RELIANCE, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF BUSINESS, REVENUES, PROFITS OR GOODWILL; AND OVATION (AND ITS LICENSORS) SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER OR ANY USER FOR AGGREGATE DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF THE FEES IT, HE OR SHE (AS THE CASE MAY BE) PAID TO OVATION DURING THE PRIOR 12 MONTHS OR US$25.00, WHICHEVER IS GREATER; EVEN IF IT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

<p><strong>Term.</strong>  Unless as otherwise specified in the Contract, Customer's and its Users' ability to access and use the Service shall commence on the date of Customer’s acceptance of the proposal for OvDs in the Contract and will automatically extend on a month-to-month basis until terminated by Customer or Ovation.

Upon Ovation’s reasonable request, such return or destruction shall be confirmed in writing by the parties. </p>
<h2 id="11-general-provisions">11. GENERAL PROVISIONS</h2>
<p><strong>Entire Agreement.</strong>  These Terms of Service (including then current Policies), together with the Contract and, if any, all Statements of Work, constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior negotiations, understandings or agreements (oral or written), among the parties regarding the subject matter hereof (and all past dealing or industry custom).  Any additional, different or inconsistent terms on any related purchase order, even if signed by the parties hereafter, shall have no effect under these Terms of Service.  In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the terms set forth in these Terms of Service and the Contract, the terms in the Contract shall control as between Ovation and Customer.  Except as expressly provided herein, no change, consent or waiver under these Terms of Service will be effective unless in writing and signed by the party against which enforcement is sought.  The failure of any party to enforce its rights under these Terms of Service at any time, for any period will not be construed as a waiver of such rights, and the exercise of one right or remedy will not be deemed a waiver of any other right or remedy.  If any provision of these Terms of Service is determined to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms of Service will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.  These Terms of Service are in English only, which language shall be controlling in all respects.  No version of these Terms of Service in another language shall be binding or of any effect.</p>
<p><strong>Governing Law.</strong>  The parties' rights and obligations under the Contract and these Terms of Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, USA, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions.  In the event of any conflict between US and foreign laws, regulations and rules, US laws, regulations and rules shall govern.  Neither the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods nor the implementation of the Computer Information Transactions Act in any jurisdiction shall apply to these Terms of Service.</p>
<p><strong>Dispute Resolution.</strong>  A printed version of these Terms of Service (and any Policy) and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to the Service, Contract or these Terms of Service (including any Policy) to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.  Customer, Users and Ovation agree that any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to the Service, Contract or these Terms of Service (including any Policy) must be commenced within 1 year after the claim or cause of action arose.  Otherwise, such claim or cause of action is permanently barred.</p>
<p>Except that either party may seek an injunction or other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction (as described below), all disputes between the parties arising out of or in relation to or in connection with the Service, Contract or these Terms of Service (including any Policy) shall be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the JAMS streamlined arbitration rules and procedures then in force, by one neutral arbitrator appointed in accordance with the rules.  The arbitration shall take place in Boston, Massachusetts, USA.  The proceedings shall be in English, all evidence shall be in English (or translated into English) and the governing law shall be as set forth herein.  The arbitrator’s decision shall be in writing and shall comply with all terms and conditions in the applicable version of these Terms of Service and the Contract.  The decision and award rendered shall be final and binding on all parties.  The parties acknowledge and agree that the Terms of Service and any award rendered pursuant hereto shall be governed by the UN Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards.  Judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p><strong>ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THESE TERMS OF SERVICE WILL TAKE PLACE ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.  CUSTOMER, USERS AND OVATION UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THE CONTRACT AND THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, EACH PARTY IS WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</strong></p>
<p>Use of the Service is not authorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of the Terms of Service, including without limitation, this section.</p>

Accessing or using the Service from other locations may be done at Customer’s or applicable User's own initiative and Customer or such User shall be liable for compliance with all local laws.  Customer each User hereby expressly consents to Ovation's processing of Service Data in accordance with these Terms of Service.  Customer and each User understands and agrees that Service Data may be stored and processed in (or transferred from) the country where it was collected and the United States, and that United States laws regarding the collection, storage, processing and onward transfer of information may be less stringent than the laws where Customer is located.  Customer and each User agrees that each person who accesses or uses the Service through its Account or his/her credentials (and each person whose information is included in Service Data) has given express consent to the collection, storage, processing, transfer, distribution, display and use of his or her personal data as provided herein.</p>
<p><strong>Remedies.</strong>  Except as expressly specified otherwise herein, each right and remedy in these Terms of Service are in addition to any other right or remedy, at law or in equity.  Each party agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of Section 5 or 6, the non-breaching party will suffer irreparable damage for which it will have no adequate remedy at law.  Accordingly, the non-breaching party shall be entitled to injunctive and other equitable remedies to prevent or restrain such breach or threatened breach, without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting any bond.</p>

Except for the foregoing or as required by any applicable law or regulation, neither Customer, User nor Ovation may issue any press release or other public announcement concerning the arrangements under these Terms of Service, or use the other party's names, trademarks or logos, without the applicable other party’s prior written consent, not to be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld.</p>

If Customer is an agency, department or other entity of the United States Government or if any User is accessing and using the Service on behalf of or for the benefit of any such entity, then the use, duplication, reproduction, modification, release, disclosure or transfer of Ovation IP is restricted in accordance with FAR 12.212 for civilian agencies and DFAR 227.7202 for military agencies.
